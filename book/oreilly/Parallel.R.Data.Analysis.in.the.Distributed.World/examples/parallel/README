This directory contains R scripts that demonstrate the "parallel"
package, and are based on examples in chapter three of the book
"Parallel R".  Note that you must be using R 2.14.0 or later to execute
these examples.  If you're using an older version of R you won't be able
to load the "parallel" package.  

The example scripts can be executed using a command such as:

  % R --slave -f parstarted.R

or using the "source" function within an R session:

  > source('parstarted.R')

Example scripts:

  parstarted.R         Using mclapply and clusterApply to implement
                       parallel kmeans
  parmakecluster.R     Creating PSOCK and FORK cluster objects
  parrng.R             Using the new L'Ecuyer-CMRG RNG with parallel
