#' Deer Endocranial Volume
#' 
#' The dataset contains the endocranial volume of 33 red deer  (Cervus 
#' elaphus), using four different methods of measurement: cardiac
#' tomography, filling the skull with glass beads (yes, the skulls are
#' from dead deer), simply measuring the length, width and height and 
#' multiplying the numbers, and using Finarelli's equation.  "Endocranial
#' volume" is a proxy for brain size.
#' 
#' @note
#' The data was kindly provided by Corina Logan.
#' Second measurements are provided for several of the deer.
#' Finarelli's equation is used for estimating the brain volume of 
#' non-bovid ruminant Artiodactylid species (say that 10 times fast).

#' English Monarchs
#' 
#' Names, dates and houses of English kings and queens from post-Roman rule
#' (the fifth century) until England invaded Ireland in the Early 13th century.
#' 
#' @note
#' This dataset is a bit messy and ambiguous in places, because history
#' is like that. In fact, the messy parts of the dataset are in general
#' a good indicator that soemthing interesting was happening at the time.
#' (See, for example, missing or multiple rulers, starts and ends of 
#' reigns in the same year, and rulers that appear several times with 
#' different territories.)  Evan defining a monarch of England is tricky.
#' Most of the monarchs in this dataset were around before England 
#' existed (it consisted of seven territories called the heptarchy).
#' The data stops before John I (the bad guy from the Robin Hood stories)
#' because he proclaimed himself King of Ireland, although some people
#' consider monarchs up to Anne, five hundred years later, to be English 
#' Monarchs even though they ruled over Ireland, Wales and Scotland to
#' varying degrees.
#' 
#' The heptarchy consisted of East Anglia, Essex, Kent, Mercia, 
#' Northumbria, Sussex and Wessex.  Northubria was originally divided into
#' Deria and Bernicia.  There are also periods of Norse and Danish rule.
#'
#' The dataset was compiled from Wikipedia and thus is not guaranteed to 
#' be error free.  Please double check the data if you want to use it for 
#' something serious.

#' Hafu
#' 
#' Half-caste manga characters.
#'
#' 
#' @note
#' The dataset was kindly provided by Gwern Branwen.
#'
#' \code{hafu2} is a lightly cleaned up version of \code{hafu}.
#' 
#' Gwern's notes: The following list includes manga, light novel, anime, 
#' and video game characters (there being little point in keeping the 
#' mediums separate). It also includes characters who are not hafu  
#' themselves but a quarter-foreign inasmuch as they imply a hafu at some  
#' point. Characters are treated separately even if they are in the same  
#' work (eg. siblings). Classification is based on in-universe or out-of- 
#' universe information, since appearance can be highly misleading in anime 
#' (blue eyes may indicate heroic status, rather than being Caucasian; hair  
#' color may be chosen for contrast against other characters or signal 
#' stereotypes like red hair indicating a fiery personality), and different 
#' groups will identify the same anime character as belonging to their own 
#' race (Lu 2009), perhaps due to minimalistic drawings intended to save  
#' money or enable viewers to project themselves onto a character.
