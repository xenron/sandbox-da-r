Problems occurred with the rowIndex parameter of the read.xlsx() function
occurred after the most recent release of the xlsx package.
As a temporary solution, until this problem gets fixed by the package
developer, the apple_stocks.xlsx file was shortened to 28 data rows. The
original apple_stocks.xlsx data file can be downloaded as
apple_stocks_original.xlsx
