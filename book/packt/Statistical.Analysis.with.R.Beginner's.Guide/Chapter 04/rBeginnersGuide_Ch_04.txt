//IMPORTING EXTERNAL DATA

> #set the R working directory
> #replace the sample location with one that is relevant to you> setwd("/Users/johnmquick/rBeginnersGuide/")

> #copy the hanzhongResources.csv file into your working directory

> #use read.csv(file) to read an external data file into R> #Shu resources located in Hanzhong, China> read.csv("hanzhongResources.csv")

//CREATING AND CALLING VARIABLES

> #read the data from hanzhongResources.csv into a variable named hanzhongResources> hanzhongResources <- read.csv("hanzhongResources.csv")

> #display the contents of the hanzhongResources variable> #Shu resources located in Hanzhong, China> hanzhongResources
