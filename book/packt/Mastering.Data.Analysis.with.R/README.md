This repository includes the example code files for the above
referenced "Mastering Data Analysis with R" book published
at Packt Publishing in 2015.


The R code files are identical to the R examples found in the
book except for the leading ">" and "+" characters, which
stand for the prompt in the R console. The prompt was
intentionally removed here along with arbitrary line-breaks,
so that you copy and paste the R expressions to the R console
in a more convenient and seamless way.

Code chunks are grouped here by the printed pages of the book.
Two hash signs at the beginning of a line stands for a page
break, while an extra empty line between the code chunks
represents one or more paragraphs in the original book between
the examples for easier navigation.

Sometimes extra instructions starting with a double hash are
also provided on how to run the below expressions.
