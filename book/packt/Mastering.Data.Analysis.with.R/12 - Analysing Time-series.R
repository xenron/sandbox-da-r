## Extracted code chunks from
##
##  Gergely DarÃ³czi (2015): Mastering Data Analysis with R.
##
##    Chapter #12: Analyzing Time-series. pp. 281-296.
##
##
##  This file includes the code chunks from the above mentioned
##  chapter except for the leading ">" and "+" characters, which
##  stand for the prompt in the R console. The prompt was
##  intentionally removed here along with arbitrary line-breaks,
##  so that you copy and paste the R expressions to the R console
##  in a more convenient and seamless way.
##
##  Code chunks are grouped here by the printed pages of the book.
##  Two hash signs at the beginning of a line stands for a page
##  break, while an extra empty line between the code chunks
##  represents one or more paragraphs in the original book between
##  the examples for easier navigation.
##
##  Sometimes extra instructions starting with a double hash are
##  also provided on how to run the below expressions.
##
