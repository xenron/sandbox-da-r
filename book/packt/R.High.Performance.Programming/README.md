# R High Performance Programming

Code examples from the book *R High Performance Programming* by Aloysius Lim and William Tjhi (January 2015, Packt Publishing).

The codes are organised by chapter, and files are named in the sequence that they appear in the book. They have been tested on R 3.1.1, which was current at the time of writing.

As far as possible, all codes have been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr, Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks, and Windows 8.1. Any exceptions to this are indicated in comments.

While most of the code should work on all operating systems, some R packages or dependencies may not. Comments in the code indicate portions which may not work on certain operating systems.
