I am a very sorry that you have had to raise your concerns. Firstly we appreciate that individuals have specific dietary requirements and we are also aware that we have not quite got it right as yet, but we are working hard to improve. We have set up a regular catering meeting with the catering department to address areas for improvement and your feedback will help us do that. I know on Redwood 2 we have had some very diverse diets & the catering department worked extremely well with us to meet the individuals requirements. Please speak to the staff on Redwood 1 as they have to order specific diets as they are not automatically available.
It is important you know and understand why you are in hospital, please ask the staff to speak to you. You are also entitled to an advocate who will get to know you and speak on your behalf at the Dr and Nurses reviews,which we know can sometimes be difficult. Sometimes family or a close friend can be a source of support in reviews also.
I will take your concerns re vegan diets to the next meeting.105251Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustRHA1042902013-07-25T15:52:30.503po","ProceduremedicationProceduresectioned","Redwood 1 Ward-  No Vegan food or explanation why I'm in hospital","","2013-07-18T13:22:48.253","","po"

I am on Trent ward at the Wells Road Centre and I wish to write about my concerns about the staffing levels on this ward. The staff on the ward do a very good job, but the work is too much for too few people. 
Due to this being an admissions ward, sometimes individual patients are unwell and require more intensive support from staff. The problem is that this has a knock-on effect for the other patients, who cannot access staff as much as they need to, which can then lead to things becoming even more difficult on the ward. 
I feel that more could be done to address this, so that pressure on staff and patients can be relieved. I would suggest seeing if staff could be moved from other wards to better accommodate the needs of patients on this ward, or getting more staff if there are not enough..","RHA_710iInpatient mental health careRHANG3 6AARHA_710iservice","Last two weeks","the patient","103965","Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Thank you for your feedback about the staffing levels on Trent Ward.

This had caused my mother lots of upset and she had been feeling really depressed because she couldn’t walk. Today we were at a really low ebb, and I told my mother she may not be able to walk again as a similar thing had happened to my father.
A community physiotherapist, Mohammed Taheed, visited our house today. He pressed on my mother’s hip, which caused her a lot of pain initially, but Taheed reassured he would “make it right. ”
After he had finished she was able to walk! She has now walked to the bathroom on her own. It is a miracle. I would like to say thank you to Taheed for helping her. He was very professional and optimistic that he could solve my mother’s problem.

"26","Dimple217","My first week was spent in King's Mill Hospital (the accident occurred in Mansfield). The early days were spent trying to come to terms with the situation, and the feeling of helplessness which accompanied it.
I asked about the chance of being moved to a Nottingham Hospital, and was offered a move to Lings Bar, a hospital unit of which I had never heard.
The first impressions of an idyllic location and supportive and friendly atmosphere certainly made an input. This is certainly not a ""cosmetic"" experience - the quality of the treatment and staff is superb. Patients are view almost as part of a family - not statistics and cases to be processed.
This atmosphere spreads through the whole hospital - allowing for the realities of hospital life, especially that of the elderly.

"42","Helrx9","I have been a volunteer on Cherry Ward Highbury Hospital (formerly B50 at the QMC Nottingham) for several months and my role is to capture patient feedback about the service provided by the ward and services provided to the ward.
Since B50 moved to Cherry Ward many of the patients have consistently complained about the food provided. Main complaints have been around the lack of variety, repetition in foods provided, that its dry and bland. The patients used to enjoy the food at the QMC and a favourite was the soup; at a meeting in June patients described the mushroom soup in particular as being 'like wallpaper paste! ' Patients would also like to have ice cream which was a daily feature at the QMC.
Ward staff invited me to stay and try the meal and check out for myself what I thought of the meal. I can only say I agree with the concerns the patients have raised and would like to see the hospital caters working with the patients to make changes.

I was pleased to hear that staff had invited you to try the food; it's good to have first hand experience of the concerns raised by the patients. Jane is exactly right, food is a crucial part of being in hospital and appetite and enjoyment of food are often the first casulties when we become ill. It is thus very important that we offer foods that are appetising and enjoyable.
We have invited the catering services to come and talk directly with the patients on Cherry Ward so that they can hear for themselves the concerns patients have.
The catering staff came to a patients meeting last wednesday (26th June) and a good discussion was had about the positives and negatives of the food provided. One of the main complaints was about the blandness of the food and we were informed that they are limited in the amount of seasoning they can add to foods, especially salt. Patients are provided with condiments and should make use of them to season foods as they prefer.
The catering team did say that they could not provide larger packs of salted butter which had been a request, but will provide small individual packs.
The caterers said that they would look at the concerns about the soup and were changing the provider for the sausages as the quality was not what was expected. Ice cream cannot be provided as apparently they have no freezers! With regard to the food being dry, they will look to provide more sauces on the menu. Puddings were a disappointment and the caters will look at the problems and try to resolve them.
At our request, buffet teas on a sunday, once a month, have been actioned and the patients will be given a questionnare to assess how well this has been received and whether to continue them.
The caterers have said they would come back and meet the patients again for further feedback, so Chris our catering liaison nurse, will invite them to another meeting soon. Meetings have been commenced by the dietican, Elizabeth, ward staff from different wards at Highbury and with the catering team to further look at our concerns re the menus and food quality. Information will be fed back to our patients at their meetings from this forum. We will keep you posted on further actions and outcomes on the patient opinion site.
I feel that a good dialogue has begun with the hospital catering services and that they are listening to our concerns, we look forward to improvements in the food they provide for us.
Many thanks again for taking the trouble to feedback your concerns, feedback enables the ward team to address concerns and improve the service we provide.

"43","it'salwaystherighttimetodotherightthing","Why is it that in Nottingham mental health inpatient settings the most common catch phrase seems to be “we haven’t got enough staff to...”.
For a relative who was in a rehabilitation unit, staff often said that they didn’t have the staff to accompany him to the shop, assist with him renewing his bus pass, arrange care plan meetings or manage difficult behaviour etc, etc.
And so the relative was transferred to an acute mental health setting, with apparently a higher level of staff. Except at the weekends there are no consultants and nobody to assess any necessary changes in treatment.
The relative didn’t improve and the staff said they were too busy to keep the family informed and they said that they didn’t have the staff to manage difficult behaviour.
The relative was moved again within days, this time to an “intensive” unit with fewer patients and more staff. The family were not informed and guess what? there still aren’t enough staff to update the family and the relative still hasn’t seen a doctor. The unit our relative originally came from said they can’t even get an update, because of lack of available staff despite a number of attempts.
The common practice seems to be to get students to fob off enquiries with “ring back later” and “I am just a student” and in the meantime our relative is passing through the mental health system, being moved from “pillar to post” without any clear plan and without involving close family and carers.
Somebody recently said that the mental health system is like a lobster pot.....easy to get into but impossible to get out of! How right they were. Is it really a staffing issue? I don’t know the answer to that, but somewhere along the line someone needs to look at what is going on in mental health inpatient services in Nottingham.","RHA_710iInpatient mental health careRHANG3 6AARHA_710iservice","Last week","a relative","100079","Steven Daykin, Acting Ward Manager, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Steven Daykin, Acting Ward Manager, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust To it'salwaystherighttimetodotherightthing,
I have read your posting and am sorry to hear of your negative experience of in-patient services. In response to staffing levels although it may seem higher levels on admission to an inpatient ward, there is also an increase in the number of people staff have to nurse when on inpatient units. Unfortunately you are correct in that there are no regular based medics on wards at weekends, however there are on-call medics to contact and would always clerk someone onto the ward on admission and attend the ward if staff saw fit. The nursing team are there to assess changes in need and treatment and would liaise with the medics if they felt necessary.
I’m sorry if you felt that staff came across as ‘too busy' to keep your family updated and informed, if there were major changes to a patients circumstances/behaviour initially it would be staff’s first concern to maintain the patients safety and treat their mental health, and then contact the family if their were major concerns. If people need moving from one ward to another we, as a nursing team would contact the named nearest relative unless other names were documented to be contacted and that the patient agreed for this to happen.
I am sorry if this did not occur and can only apologise again to you.
In response to you being dealt with by a student nurse, it is part of their nurse training to liaise with carers and families alike under supervision by staff nurses, and I am sorry if you felt that no clear plan could be explained to you.
Staffing levels on wards are a contentious subject and are attempted to be maintained at a level which is safe and assists our patients in being safe and having therapeutic interactions and facilitating escorts. Unfortunately due to covering and supporting other ward patient needs, unforeseen reduced staffing levels E.g. such as sickness, staff teams have to be moved where need necessitates which can have a huge impact on addressing immediate patient need.
Finally I want to say thank you for feeling you can put your concerns across on this site, where we as a Trust read and listen to opinion and feedback in the necessary management meeting using your comments to improve our service.

I would love to say that our experience was a 'one off' but it really isn't. My relative has transferred again since my posting - moving full circle. To be fair I have spoken with a true gem of a nurse on your ward (Sam) which proves that it is possible to communicate and keep family involved and informed. Generally though the problems continue...being told by another student, after she had spoken to the nurse in charge, that the family can't attend the next review meeting, because it's for doctors only apparently..then finding out this wasn't the case at all. External parties were invited to the review to talk about my relative's care - it was only the family who were excluded. And trying to get any sense of what the plan is for my relative, well that is a different story all together.1017241000792013-06-28T12:54:04.537po","Procedurecare planConditionintensive careConditionmental healthConditionrehabilitationProceduretreatment","Lack of staff in the lobster pot?","","2013-06-18T15:44:31.543","","po"
"44","bikerboy","I see an in patient on a regular basis for social activities outside his unit. Recently he has become unwell as a result of trying a new drug. He has had to be moved from his unit as they did not feel they could manage his behaviour. He went to Highbury to a unit with greater capacity to care for him. They claimed he was too difficult to manage. He then was moved to the Highbury Intensive care unit. What bothers me is that, despite being so unwell that he needed to move, he has not seen a Doctor at either unit at Highbury and there has been no review of his medication. It feels like he is stuck in a unit that should address the underlying issues ie is he on the correct drug? Yet there has been no medical oversight of his care. He was moved late last week and its now mid week and I am sure this is not correct. The mantra I keep hearing at all of these places is there are not enough staff.","RHA_710iInpatient mental health careRHANG3 6AARHA_710iservice","Yesterday","a relative","100075","Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Dear Bikerboy
Thank you for taking the time to feedback and for raising these areas of concern. I have forwarded your posting to the in-patient services manager and the Associate Director of Nursing Quality and Patient Experience for further comment.
Please be reassured we take all feedback seriously as listening to what people say is the only way we can improve our services and communications.
A further response will be posted soon.100391Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust RHA1000752013-06-19T14:28:18.197poSteven Daykin, Acting Ward Manager, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Steven Daykin, Acting Ward Manager, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust To Bikerboy
After looking at your comments and indirect experience of your friend’s negative experience of in-patient services, sometimes when new treatment plans are changed, to attempt to improve someone’s mental health initially people’s mental state can take a dip in level and this to me sounds a possible cause in your friend’s circumstance. On the whole admissions are onto an inpatient ward, but due to the individuals’ safety and their mental state /behaviour they have to be moved to a intensive care area where their are less patients and increased staffing levels. This is done through a thorough decision making process involving all members of the multi-disciplinary team (often including Doctors).
Your main concerns were around your friend not seeing a Doctor, Doctors would always clerk someone onto the ward on admission and attend the ward if staff saw fit. Depending on when your friend was admitted (I.e. at weekends) then no regular doctors on at a weekend and also depending on when your friends consultants reviews are they may not see their consultant straight away but they should see a junior doctor at least, and if this did not occur then I am sorry about this and would want to know a little more information so I can look into this in more detail. However the nursing team are there to assess changes in need and treatment and would liaise with the medics if they felt necessary.
Your point about being on the right type of medication is a difficult one as with not knowing more details I would not like to go into different medication unnecessarily, but what I would say is that at times consultants feel that it is the person’s best interest to change their medication to attempt to improve their mental health. Unfortunately in some cases this does not always have the expected response initially, but it might seem like things are being left but the team maybe waiting
Finally to respond to your point on there not seeming enough staff on, Staffing levels on wards are a contentious subject and are attempted to be maintained at a level which is safe and assists our patients in being safe and having therapeutic interactions and facilitating escorts. Unfortunately due to covering and supporting other ward patient needs, unforeseen reduced staffing levels E.g. such as sickness, staff teams have to be moved where need necessitates which can have a huge impact on addressing immediate patient need.
I would just like to say thank you for feeling you can put your concerns across on this site, where we as a Trust read and listen to opinion and feedback in the necessary management meeting using your comments to improve our service.

I was detailed a lovely committed lady - Speech and Language Therapist Margaret Metcalfe who helped me from that time on to now. She was very patient and the care I received was first class. She helped improve my swallow. She provided numerous stimuli, puzzles and written work to help me to regain my speech as well as spoken words and phrases and sentences. She also liaised very closely with my GP. She marked my homework and gave me incentives to work on instead of my vegetating. I consider myself very fortunate to have had such good care and to work with such a professional lovely lady as Margaret.

In the busy and difficult times on Lister ward we have received support and advice from the whole unit and this has boosted the confidence of the whole team.
We have a number of areas in which we want to develop but I think we are gradually and steadily developing. I feel proud to say that all disciplines particularly our nurses have invested most of their time in the direct patient care and this does help us most in improving the quality of care.

When I first arrived I noticed straight away how nice the ward smelt, it was lovely and fresh with windows open etc.
I have been in a bay of 4 beds and I'm now in a side room with a toilet and shower. The domestic staff are brilliant, my bathroom is kept very clean which is always done first thing and then later they come back with a different trolley to clean my room. I think this is brilliant.
The nursing staff are fantastic, the level of care is second to none. Nothing is every too much trouble for them and they always take the time to listen to you if you have and problems, and try to sort them out for you.
Our ward co-ordinator Suzzie is great. Whilst here I have to have a special diet and Suzzie has made sure that I have the right food every day and if it's not right she will go to the kitchens and get things sorted every time. Nothing is ever too much trouble for her and she always has time for a little chat.
So far, my experience here is excellent and my as much as I want to be at home my stay here is very comfortable and friendly.
I can't really find anything to complain about and feel my stay here couldn't be made any easier than it is now.

Being very poorly I have little recollection of that time except that the HDU staff were very professional and the food was very good. My neurologist was fully involved in helping me to recover from the (apparently common) Intensive care paranoia syndrome.
After 2 weeks I was transferred on a Friday afternoon from QMC to Lings Bar Hospital (John Procter ward) for rehabilitation. As it was a bank holiday weekend, there was little activity (i.e. no physiotherapists or consultant) until the following Tuesday. At the time this was quite frustrating but because recovery from my illness needs rest and time, this was probably best for me.
As with QMC, the food was very good and I felt free to exercise at my own pace.
The staff were very friendly and encouraging, answered my questions and took time to explain what was happening.
I am sure that the caring atmosphere in the ward helped me to recover sufficiently to go home after only 2 weeks.

As I prepare to leave her majesty's pleasure on Monday I cannot go without saying thank you to everyone in the healthcare department at HMP Whatton for their care and support for their care and support throughout my stay.
It all started last November when I arrived here and now it's ending on Monday. My first thanks go to those who have supported me through some pretty bad times but have always lifted my spirits. Thank you also to those that spent time with me and with me and making me see that life is worth living. Thank you to those that always made me laugh and making a great team.
My second thanks go to the nurses who have helped me along the way. They always made me smile with their laugh and I will never forget that.

I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude and appreciation in the way I, as a registered disabled inmate with various disabilities, have been treated from the day I arrived here at Whatton in July. I have been in prison for six years now and in all that time and before I arrived at HMP Whatton I have experienced difficulties in discrimination on many occasions because of my disabilities.
HMP Whatton is totally the opposite in the way your Health Care Dept and Prison Officers address disabled inmate's issues and difficulties, let me try and explain what I am trying to express.
1/ Within minutes of arrive in reception the reception staff quickly made themselves aware of my disability status (I had quite a lot of medical supplies) and they took me to one side where they were extremley helpful and discreet in explaining everything I needed to know relating to disability matters here at Whatton. My first impression of HMP Whatton was very positive (first time in six years).
2/ Again, within one hour of arriving at Whatton I had a visit from a nurse in health care who took the time going through all my medical and disability needs, she even had an appointment for me to see the prison Doctor for two days later, (up to this point I have always had to wait up to four weeks to see somebody from health care). The nurse was very reassuring.
When I arrived at Unit A4 I was greeted by a prison officer took who me into the office (reception had already been on the phone to her to explain about my disabilities) and again she was very helpful and explained that I would be in a single room for dignity and hygiene and that I should approach her or any member of the unit staff if ever I had any issues. I was also told that I could use the disabled shower for dignity (apart from the two years I spent at in Therapy at Dovegate Theraputic Community, I have always had to use the showers as other inmates. This was times very humiliating and embarrassing). 
I also had a visit from an insider and diversity and disability reps (all of them trained inmates) and again they went through everything with me. (They were and are still unaware of my disabilities which I feel is right), I just wasn't used to all this help and supporting relating to my medical/disability problems. I must mention the A4 Unit Orderly, inmate who was the only inmate who knew of my disabilities, who was extremely helpful and discreet and continues to be since I left Unit a4.
4/ For the next week I went through the prison induction programme where I met and talked to the various departments, (in my previous prisons I was lucky if I was given a 30 minute induction) I found the Whatton induction programme was so helpful and in-depth and because it was spread over seven days I was able to learn and take on board more that if was all crammed into a shorter space of time. The only concern I learnt from the induction was the; length of time I would have to wait to continue with my offending behaviour programmes.
5/ My first initial appointment with the prison doctor went extremeley well. I was with the doctor for 45 minutes (unheard of in my previous prisons) and he was so precise in going through all my medical and disability needs even changing some of my medication and medical supplies for the better. I was given a full medical and various tests where carried out due to my age and disabilities. (the first time these tests have ever been carried out) I also had a meeting with the continence coordinator who made me feel at ease and comfortable when we where discussing my disabilities. She is very discreet when I have to attend the health care to pick up further continence supplies. (in my previous prisons, these supplies where brought to my cell in the presence of staff and inmates, so undignified and humiliating).
6/ After spending only 10 days on Unit A4 I was moved onto Unit A8 and into a fully equipped disabled room. Officers introduced themselves to me and they spent time letting me know who the regime on Unit 8 worked. They were also aware of my disabilities and told me to approach any member of staff if ever I needed help. I was also introduced to the Unit's disability awareness co-ordinator who I have to admit has been a Godsends in the help and assistance he has given me and all other disabled residents here on Unit A8. In the nine weeks that I have been on Unit A8 I have had no issues and the staff on the unit are constantly asking if I am ok and if I need anything, some of the staff regularly visit the rooms/cells to make sure that all is well.
7/ Everything at Whatton has been positive but the biggest event for me since I arrived here is the gymnasium and the attitude from the gym staff towards disabled inmates. When I went to the gym for my introduction the first thing the gym officer said was it does not matter how unfit or disabled you are, we can help with some sort of gym activity and he and his staff want to see us down using the gym.
Before I came into prison I was fairly fit but the past six years and before I arrived at HMP Whatton, I found it very difficult accessing gym facilities due to my medical and disability problems and I was never encouraged to do so. During my gym induction the gym officer took me aside and we discussed my disabilities. He informed me that they were not an issue for him and his staff and soon as I got clearance from Health Care I could start using the gym. Health Care cleared me for modified gym but no heavy lifting or contact sport due to medical equipment I have to wear. 
In the nine weeks that I have been using the gym, the staff have involved me in various activities including involving me in a Football Course every Tuesday asking me to officiate (Linesman) in the football and rugby matches. I have even lost about 10 Kilos in weight and the gym has helped me with my self-esteem.
8/ I am still waiting to start work but hope to be working in the gardens doing light duties. I have to wait until I am at Whatton three months before I am considered.","RHAY4HMP WhattonRHANG13 9FQRHAY4prison","Last year","a staff member","95262","","ConditioncontinenceConditiondisabilityConditiondisabledProceduremedication","How the prison has helped me with my disability","","2013-05-10T10:10:09.53","","po"

I have been at Whatton since May and am writing to sincerely thank you and your staff for the excellent care you have provided for me.
I have diabetes which is tablet and diet controlled and therefore need regular reviews and HBAIC blood tests. These have always been done exactly on time and are also very thoroughly and considerately carried out. The nurse who did my last diabetes review was extremely knowledgeable and answered many of my questions.
Recently I have had an eye screen which has detected some diabetic retinopathy and again my eye test and optician's appointment was quickly provided as were my new glasses. My outside appointment at QMC was prompt and efficient.
Some weeks ago I injured a wrist in the gym and despite rest and medication it has not fully improved. Today I had an appointment with a physio who gave me a thorough examination of my injury, lots of advice on rehabilitation and a very clear and detailed explanation of what I had done.
Once again I left healthcare reassured and very satisfied with the care I have received.
I have made mistakes in my life for which I am now paying. I regret them deeply but I do appreciate the care and compassion shown by your staff. It is very easy consider yourself the lowest of the low when you are in prison and to lose your self-respect and dignity. The attitude of your excellent staff and the efficient care they provide has certainly made me feel like a 'proper' person again and has a positive impact upon my health and wellbeing.
It is so easy to moan and complain when things are bad and I feel the least I can do is to offer my praise and thanks to you when things are good.
Thank you for all you do.","RHAY4HMP WhattonRHANG13 9FQRHAY4prison","Today","a staff member","95258","","ConditiondiabetesConditiondiabeticProceduredietPart of bodyeyeConditioninjuryProcedurephysioConditionretinopathyPart of bodywrist","The least I can do is offer thanks","","2013-05-10T09:12:54.577","","po"

I have recently learnt that the hospital benefits officer is being made redundant. This fact has not been widely publicised to patients and I am concerned that there are no suitable alternative arrangements in place to replace this valuable support. I have along with other patients received excellent support from the benefits officer in sorting out my finances. Welfare benefits is a complex area especially in view of recent changes to the benefits system and I am concerned that patients in the Wells Road Centre will not have expert assistance. Whilst there may be alternatives available in the community patients here cannot make use of these facilities. Patients cannot access the Internet for this information. How will this important need be met when the benefits officer leaves?","RHANottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustRHANG3 6AANottinghammental health trust","Last week","a volunteer/advocate","93898","Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Dear BB1

Thank you for leaving your feedback93962Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust RHA938982013-04-24T19:44:08.307poYvonne Bird, Community Forensics OT, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustYvonne Bird, Community Forensics OT, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustThank you for raising this concern
The Trust Benefits Officer role has been a real support for patients throughout the Trust for many years. A review by Local Services in 2012 identified however, that the support offered by this post was also available from different sources, including through the Involvement Centre and the Recovery College based at Duncan Macmillan House. These services reflected what was available to people living independently in the community, and were widely accessible to those within in-patient settings. As a result these services have taken a lead in offering support across the city and county of Nottingham for individuals under the Trust’s care who apply for and receiving appropriate benefits.
Patients from the Wells Road Centre are able to easily access this service given their close proximity to the Recovery College, and as such the majority of our
in-patients will be able to gain support, advice and direction for a range of issues including applying for benefits.
There are a proportion of patients who will not be able to access these community provisions during the early stages of their treatment. As a result the Wells Road Centre has worked extremely hard to become a satellite campus of the Trust Recovery College and as such will be providing a range of educational and skills based sessions from the Recovery College Prospectus, within our Centre, to our in-patients. This will include support around applying for and accessing benefits. Finally, the Wells Road Centre will link with other Trust Directorates to ensure that the most up to date literature and practical guidance will be available to patients across the Wells Road Centre”.

Well's Road Centre,
Low Secure Service94505Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustRHA938982013-04-29T10:54:24.98poAdvocacy TogetherAdvocacy TogetherThank you for your prompt response and I note the contents and your reassurance that the Trust involvement Centre and Recovery College at Duncan Mcmillan House are going to provide ""the support offerred by this post"" (Tust Benefits Officer).
The Trust Benefits Officer has responded to requests for help from patients, visiting the wards, completing forms, following up complex benefits and other financial issues, negotiating with other agencies etc. He has been easily contactable and able to respond quickly thus reassuring patients who are often experiencing extreme mental distress which can be compounded by financial difficulties. He has been able to visit patients on the ward which is valuable as many patients are unable to leave the wards. He has extensive knowledge and skills so can help settle people and offer reassurance which gives confidence to people.
I have contacted the Recovery College who appear to have no knowledge of being identified as a replacement for the service provided by the Trusts Benefits Officer.
Whilst I would welcome the proposed courses on benefits it is very clear that this will not replace the valuable, personal, easily accessible service offerred by the Benefits Officer identified above. Indeed I believe the 2 hour course provided by The Recovery College will only run periodically with limited numbers of places available to patients.
My concerns about the loss of this service remain and are shared by many other patients within the Wells Road Centre. Myself and fellow patients at The Wells Road Centre would feel far more reassured if there was a more defined, specific replacement for the service provided by the Benefits Officer than that outlined in your initial response. I hope you are able to clarify how these complex, individual patient needs are going to be met in the future
Thanks
BB194809938982013-05-01T10:55:59.303poYvonne Bird, Community Forensics OT, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustYvonne Bird, Community Forensics OT, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustFirstly we would like to apologise for any misleading information given within our first response in regard to support offered by the Recovery college and Involvement centres around benefits. The support offered is via gaining the understanding of the benefits system as opposed to individual advice.
It is important that we do acknowledge that the service that was provided at the Wells Road Centre will no longer be available, this undoubtably will be a great loss.
What we need to focus on is what will be available:
Courses delivered at the Recovery college that will develop your own understanding of the benefits system.
We are currently organising for staff to attend a course which will enable them to support and signpost patients to gain relevant advice in managing their benefits
We are liaising with the course facilitator in regard to further training
we will facilitate wherever possible for patients to access the community facilities that are available for one to one benefit advice.
We will display posters and have leaflets available with useful contact numbers and will facilitate any calls in relation to benefits advice free of charge
We will ensure that all patients at the Well's Road Centre are informed of the future changes and hear their views via ward community meetings and any feedback from these meetings will be fed into the management team

"114","Fresh123","Since May 2012 CAMHS have supported me along with Nottinghamshire Social Services and many more referrals including WHAM, The Sett at Northamptonshire and many more emergency services available. 
As some people would disagree, anxiety and depression is a main problem in my family with losing close family members making things worse. Growing up with family members having alcohol problems can be unbearable to cope with as I’m not going into too much detail.
My life was revolving around school and not knowing what to come home to. With my confidence being severely low, 'opening up' to people was difficult, as I thought bottling my thoughts up was the best way at the time. Eventually I turned to self-harm and suicidal attempts. With no support or family to talk to, the resurgents were not there. Being the quite girl that nobody talked to I was slowly digging myself into a black hole that I thought no one understood. 
I got proven wrong when I was hospitalised for a suicide attempt. All my family members turned the other cheek but my mum. After a while of treatment, me and my mother’s relationship slowly got better till she realised the damage she has done to me is not going to be easily washed away.
I needed all the support I could get at the time. I was not bothered I only got sectioned in the mental health service on a family bereavement and soon wanted to change. We all discussed medication that I was not sleeping well or even settling down well. 
Now I look back without the help of these services, I couldn't have been the person I am today. I have no doubt I can still get help when I need it. However for any others struggling who need these services, they have a long waiting list. It shouldn’t be like this. I know there are many people out there but I do recommend the NHS is needed more by young people and the society itself too. By talking to that one person, I opened a lot of opportunities.","RHA_711Child and adolescent mental healthRHANG3 6AARHA_711serviceRP1_711Child and adolescent mental healthRP1NN15 7PWRP1_711service","Unknown","the patient","93747","Hugh Jones, Service User and Carer Involvement Lead , Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS Foundation TrustHugh Jones, Service User and Carer Involvement Lead , Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS Foundation TrustThank you so much for sharing your story.

Although the team supported me in my journey, perhaps the service needs to adapt to who they are seeing.

"122","Hellokitty23","I was disappointed with the IAPT service, I felt my therapist was not open to any discussion regarding the sessions even after asking my opinion if I said something was not working or that I didn't feel better I felt the therapist blamed me and didn't offer any solutions or alternatives. I felt this attitude meant we could not build a very good relationship. This then wasn't helped when my therapist was off sick for a long period of time.  Towards the end of this period I was informed that I could see another therapist to complete my treatment. I feel I should have been offered the option of seeing another therapist sooner as it meant I had long gaps without any sessions and I felt my treatment lost momentum.
I was offered no choice about the time and location of my appointments and had to travel to an area of Nottinghamshire that I do not live in to receive therapy. The sessions were held in a room at a Contact Centre however the room was located directly off a busy area of the centre. The room the sessions were held in had a large glass window in the door which was not covered with a blind meaning anyone outside in the centre could see in. As the room was located in a public building I don't think this maintained a high level of privacy. Also when waiting for appointments I was asked to wait directly outside the room where I could hear what was being discussed by the person inside. Again as this was a public area members of the public would have been able to hear too if they had chosen to take a seat outside the room. I think if sessions are to be held in public buildings which are used for other purposes the room the sessions are held in should be located at least in a quiet and private area.
At the end of my sessions I was given a feedback form to complete. I was instructed by the therapist to complete this now and hand it straight back to them. I think the feedback form should have been sent through the post or via email so I could have completed and returned it anonymously. Many people may not feel comfortable giving honest feedback if they know they have to hand the form straight back to their therapist.","RHA_656Clinical psychologyRHANG3 6AARHA_656service","Last year","a service user","92895","Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Dear Hellokitty23

To do this would you be able to tell us a bit more about the service you received and where the sessions were held? IAPT are City and County Wide and provide a lot of services in different locations. In the meantime I will send the posting to the service managers for City and County as I know they will want to hear about any service that leaves poeple feeling disappointed.
I can only apologise and hope that we can improve your experience to bring benefits to others using this service. in the future.
We appreciate your feedback and take seriously all the things you have told us about.

Although you have not named the venue you were seen at, we think from your description it may be a Contact Centre in Sutton in Ashfield. One of the service team leaders has personally visited the venue and checked the noise levels and agrees with you regarding noise and privacy. There is a chair directly outside the room which does pose the risk of conversations being overheard. There are also three glass areas in the door which means patients can be viewed from outside the room.
To address these issues we are making changes, they are as follows:
* The door Glass will be covered up to provide privacy.
* Therapy to take place at the top of the room where voices cannot be heard clearly.
* Chairs directly outside the room will be moved away to maintain confidentiality
I was disappointed to hear you were not offered a choice of time or location as we offer therapy in many places throughout Nottingham and Nottinghamshire and usually try to accommodate patient's choice in relation to where and when they would like to be seen. I will discuss this further with the office manager as the admin team coordinate appointments.
You should have been given the opportunity to return your feedback form anonymously we apologise for not giving you that option and we will communicate to staff the importance of informing patients they can send their feedback form back anonymously.
I hope this goes some way to answer your concerns? As I don't have the name of the therapist you saw I will feedback your concerns to the staff as a group. If you would like to discuss anything you mentioned in your posting further please do not hesitate to get in touch with me in the meantime thank you for taking the trouble to post on the Patient Opinion site and please be assured we take all your comments and concerns seriously.

As the waiting list crept toward this maximum time limit, extra services where commissioned which has met this issue and has dramatically altered the waiting time.
This now stands at 4 weeks. We have also introduced extra Dental nurse triage clinics as it appeared that many of the people seeing the dentist did not actually need to, as their issue was resolved by the dental nurses at triage.
We did also have a large number of people not attending appointments generally within healthcare. We have also dramatically reduced these by the use of very simple measures of delivering appointments direct to prisoners cells ourselves and not using the prison system.
Any person suffering dental pain waiting for any appointment can ask for analgesia from nurses at medicine hatches or a general appointment which will hopefully reduce any discomfort they may have. Wing officers can also ring me to discuss issues brought to them by individuals.
I as Matron am always available to discuss any issues patients may have. I can be contacted by posting a Pals form, available on all wings and generally arrive with me swiftly.
I do hope this answers the issues you describe.93025Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustRHA918442013-04-17T10:30:12.53po","","having to wait so long means the condition has got worse","","2013-04-05T08:22:45.627","","po"

"129","Nurture","My daughter was displaying very worrying behaviour - refusing to eat, hiding under bed and saying she didn't want to live her life. Concerned as she also talked about wanting to die. 
Phoned CAMHS but as it was bank holiday I got a recorded message saying to call my GP. 
I did that and another recorded message said no out of hours service so phone 111. 
Phoned 111, took 10 mins to get through was told we were 'high priority' and would receive call back ASAP. By this time daughter even more distressed so managed to persuade her  to come out from under bed and my husband dropped us at A+E.
We were seen very quickly by Dr. who also tried to contact CAMHS. Eventually we were told to wait to see on call psychiatrist who could be hours. 
No one at hospital had access to my daughters notes so we had to go through her history several times. 
Eventually we were taken up to a ward some 5 hours later. On call psychiatrist tried to talk to us in the busy ward but I insisted on privacy. 
Taken to a room where Dr informed us that they were an adult psychiatrist. They then asked my daughter a series of painful and inappropriate questions even though I had explained her history. They also answered their phone 5 times and took a consultation about somebody's anti psychotic medication with a nurse while we remained in the room. They complained about their over busy schedule and joked about whether or not they would make it through their shift. 
The whole consultation was a terrifying experience for my fragile and young daughter, and only when we were about to leave the hospital did I find the courage to make a complaint. 
A caring and reassuring registrar then apologised and insisted we saw a CAMHS Dr. Although we had to wait a further hour and my daughter was desperate to return home, I felt we still needed help which after around 7hours in hospital we had yet to receive. 
The Dr. we did end up seeing was a CAMHS specialist and our short time with her made all the difference. 
I am now considering making a complaint to the hospital.","nhs-111NHS 111nhs-111organisationRHA_711Child and adolescent mental healthRHANG3 6AARHA_711service","Yesterday","a parent/guardian","91455","Team leader, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS trustTeam leader, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS trustDear “Nurture”
Thank you for sharing your feedback about the service you received over the Bank Holiday when your daughter was so obviously unwell, it must have been very worrying for you as a family.
Your recent experience and difficulties gaining access to the local Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (C.A.M.H.S.) during the Bank Holiday period was clearly unacceptable. I am very sorry for the problems that both you, and your daughter have experienced. The comments you made about the behaviour of staff and the terrifying experience you mention has been noted and your posting has been passed on to our colleagues in Adult Mental Health for comment as it is not part of the C.A.M.H.S Service.
However, I am pleased that the registrar was kind and caring and when you finally saw a C.A.M.H.S. professional your concerns were dealt with and it made a difference.. We do appreciate feedback good and bad as it is the only way to improve services so thank you for taking the time to share your story.
If you are still considering making a complaint or want a chat about the experience in more detail I can recommend our Patient Advice and Liaison Service (P.A.L.S.) who would be more than happy to speak to you.
It’s confidential and you can be assured they will listen.

I am somewhat perplexed by the comments made.
I can understand that being the first time in prison can be a somewhat overwhelming experience.
I am pleased that you had a discussion about your diabetes and its control.
However, I do fail to see how advice about being better controlled is seen as unhelpful.
Within prisons we are not in a position to allow patients to have scales to weigh food or control their diet to their own specification.
We can offer better dietary information and sugar tablets as you describe them are available to any person suffering type 1 diabetes.

I asked for a filling but they said no because my teeth on the bottom left are bad and are not worth filling. I asked how many teeth they wanted to take out and they said five. I said no and walked out.
My point I want to make is my dentist near my home put a filling in my teeth about three years ago and said if it came out one day to come and see them again and they will put another filling in.
In prison this is completely different and in my experience, the dentist here will not do what the prisoner wants. It also takes us about five weeks to see a dentist. 
If somebody is in pain and wants to see the dentist you cant do anything apart from wait and wait until your time comes and be seen in five weeks.

Our prescriptions are fulfilled by a supplying pharmacy and delivered to us.
If your prescription is done during the week it can take up to 3 days usually for the stock to arrive.

We at Stocken are in the process of reviewing all of the care we give and to date the challenges we have are being met by Notts Heathcare Trust.
This review is not a means to reduce services but to get smart and be inventive with the funding we have and the way we use it.

"145","Creative Minds","The 'Creative Minds' Group has been running for the past 9 weeks in North Nottinghamshire, delivering Diaectical Behavioural Skills to young people.
Young People's Feedback.
'The support group was led by 3 young professionals, who were very friendly. We found the age of the facillitators useful as they had a good understanding of current issues that impact on young people today. We were able to feel comfortable whilst speaking in the group forum, and felt safe to do this.
DBT skills were delievered to the targetted audience in a creative manner. Group members have taken some of the skills away, and put these into practice. We have found many of the skills helpful.
We appreciated the venue being a distance away from the usual clinic, this we feel reduced stigma, as well as promoting social inclusion. The room was less formal, and ensured a positive working environment for all.
Social time was incorporated within the group- we found this initially 'awkward' however recognised the social skills developed from this exercise. The group learnt to socialise with people from different backgrounds, sharing life experiences. Group members have utilsed many of the skills enhanced during the group, and have been successful during college interviews as a consequence. There was an overall sense of pride when acheivements were shared in the group- and much laughter was had by all.
There were two points highlighted that could be changed. A member of the group considered that an alternative to speaking would at times be useful to ensure everybody's feelings and emotions were expressed. The group members shared wishes for all group members to remain permanent, as this could at times be disruptive. Facillitators shared this hope for future groups, and discussions surrounding the retention of group members was held. We felt that facillitators have taken ideas on board and will review this should a future group be carried forward'.","RHA_711Child and adolescent mental healthRHANG3 6AARHA_711service","Last six months","the patient","90641","Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust CAMHS North Team run the group called 'Creative minds'

I found the staff very warm and accommodating they were very helpful and this time they had put ‘market stalls on’. This allowed us to walk around and look at the various stalls focusing on Recovery. This helped us understand what my son does with nurses, Occupational therapists, Social workers, CBT therapist Education and they had an LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans gender) group that patients were promoting.
They also produced another excellent lunch allow us to sit down with my son and have a meal with the family in a busy sociable setting it was just like a party or celebration. A very enjoyable day, I am sure the other several other families felt the same.

Thank you for your idea and as you say there is a lot of interest in football for the under 5's. The centres in Ashfield have just set up some 6 week skills sessions for 18 months to 5 years in Sutton and Kirkby and soon to be in Selston during the week and Sundays. The Toddlers 4 Fun sessions use football as a fun way to have physical exercise and develop skills based on agility, balance and coordination.The group in Sutton has been so popular that it has been extended and are a great way for dads in particular to get involved with their children's development.
I have put your idea about starting a team for under 5s to Andy White who has been the lead on this work. He will discuss with the parents, coach and volunteers attending the sessions as to how or if this could work locally. I will keep you updated.
In the meantime if you want to know more about the Toddlers 4 Fun sessions contact Andy on 0115 753828

"154","ChebbyLandWantingTheEnd","In the year 2011 my life felt like it was falling apart, I thought that everything was going wrong. I lost interest in absolutely everything I used to love, I stopped talking to people, I just felt empty and lost, though I felt almost suicidal I kept on fighting, I had to help my friends as well as they kept unloading their problems onto me. In this year I began to self-harm and took my very first overdose, but I was too scared to tell anyone; I didn't think anyone would care either, they would have thought that it was all for attention.
I managed to put up with the rest of that year, but then 2012 came, that year had to be the worst I have ever been through. In early January I took my second overdose, I ended up in hospital because my mother found out (she said she didn't see it coming even though I told her months ago that I felt depressed). Before I took the pills I couldn't help but to think that I was all alone, not a single person understood me, no matter how loud I shouted for help, no one came. I then got referred to CAMHS. I talked to a lovely female worker. She tried to help me and she got me through the year; we talked about the things that were bothering me, my past, the people in my life and how I could make things better. Though I was starting to feel better, I had quite a few bad days which totalled up to me having around 10 more overdoses on separate occasions, but my family and CAMHS worker only know about one of those 10. At my penultimate appointment I remember trying to tell my worker that I still didn't feel right. I talked to her about my self-harm and her reply was ''it is something that you will have to live with, maybe it's a part of you, it's what you do.'' She also told me to just pretend that everything was fine. In my head she was saying that hurting myself and not being happy was normal. I got discharged in early December because she thought I was ready to handle the world by myself. I thought I was ready too.
Not long after Christmas in 2012 things started to feel wrong again, but in a completely different way. Before when I got referred to CAMHS there were actual problems that were affecting my life. However, now there are no physical problems that I'm facing, only ones in my mind. It feels as if there are filing cabinets in my head and something is inside of me ruining the order of the paperwork so nothing makes any sense. I've started to feel alone again, like I'm in a black hole with no escape, I also started self-harming again and continued to take a small overdose.
Although I found CAMHS a bit helpful, I feel as if my worker failed to listen to me properly. Though I enjoyed talking to my worker about my problems, she never actually helped me out, she just talked at me. I am still so confused and feeling very low and I have no clue of what to do about it because I do not have my worker anymore. I did not find my experience of CAMHS to be very good, but other people might so it's worth a try. Even if the service only helps someone feel better for a week or a month, there's the chance it could last forever, meaning that someone's life is saved. I do recommend this service, but it will only work if the patient is completely honest with their worker.","RHA_711Child and adolescent mental healthRHANG3 6AARHA_711service","Last six months","the patient","88894","Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Thank you for sharing your experience of CAMHS on Patient Opinion.

"156","Josh Murphy","As a long term user of mental health services, I have benefitted hugely from this course and it is potentially being scrapped as there is no longer funding available for the Tutors.
This course has been like a lifeline to me in so many ways. Despite my ongoing mental health problems, the Course has been a welcome relief which has enabled me to fully engage in something in a non- threatening environment and rekindle my passion for a subject which my depression had thwarted. It has been a chance for someone who is otherwise very isolated, to meet and mix with a thoroughly lovely bunch of like- minded individuals. I went from being initially terrified of the group set up to genuinely looking forward to sharing, debating and listening within this lively diverse group. It has truly been a breath of fresh air and given me something to look forward to each week.
From the bottom of my heart I cannot praise the Recovery College enough. I am so grateful that I have finally found something that ""fits"" my circumstances. For many years I have felt totally at a loss as to how on Earth I was going to get my life back on track after such a long period of unemployment, hospitalisations and ongoing health problems.
I had often wondered what, if any, provision there was for people who are over the most acute phase of their illness and are now desperate to try to rebuild/ establish a life for themselves. I knew what I was looking for and desperately searched for it but it just didn't appear to exist. The only two options available to me were to attend a (chronic) day centre or try to cope in a mainstream educational establishment.
Square pegs and round holes spring to mind! Neither of these options were right for me. The day centres I visited were thoroughly depressing places full of very unwell people who didn't seem to have much hope. The atmosphere was very institutionalised and the vast majority of the clientele had been attending for years without any apparent improvement in their condition.
I had also tried to return to formal mainstream education on several occasions. Despite ticking the disability box and writing very clearly on applications that I expected I would need quite abit of (emotional) support to enable me to cope with the various social and academic demands, time and again this support failed to materialise or was woefully inadequate. Usually, the only point at which any student welfare services stepped in was when I was already in crisis and it is much harder to help someone who is feeling very stressed and anxious and has got themselves very behind with their workload than to support them along the way so that the crisis is avoided in the first place.
The Recovery College is refreshingly different in it's approach because it's underlying ethos is so positive. If it could talk (bear with me! ), it would say ""Yes, you've had problems but so what? If you want to learn things, meet people, get used to being in groups, have some structure in your life, do something valid with your time, feel a sense of purpose and that you can achieve something, all in a friendly, supportive environment where you can dictate the pace, feel free to come along. Not everything will be right for you, but that's ok too- we're very flexible and work with you. Give us a ring. No pressure.

Thank you for taking the time to feedback and comment on the Recovery College. It is good to hear that you find the college ‘refreshingly different’, somewhere positive where you feel you can try to rebuild/establish a life for yourself, at your own pace, with a sense you can achieve something in a friendly supportive environment.
In relation to the Reading for Healing course which seems, from your posting, to have been extremely helpful to you and has given you back a passion you previously had for literature. I can confirm the current tutor is no longer available to run the course at the college, however, the college works with over 40 tutors from 27 different partnerships, some within the Trust but many from the local community eg. Central College Nottingham and the Workers Education Association. I am very hopeful that through these partnerships I will be able to find a tutor to deliver a course around Literature and reading to support recovery in the near future.
If you would like to contact the college I will personally update you as to the progress on getting a course around this subject for the Autumn Term 2013 I would also be happy to look at your next learning plan with you to see if there are any other courses in the Summer Term which may be of interest to you. We hoping to have the prospectus available in the next two weeks, we have a total of 52 courses some of which are new for the Summer Term 2013,
Thanks again for your feedback, posts like this continue to inspire us to get it right for our students and explore all options available to us.
Kind regards

In response,
Thank you for posting this positive and touching tribute to the Recovery college. I really like the way you have anticipated what the College would say to its students if it could speak - and I am sure you are right about what it says to people who find their lives transformed by their experience here. Can I reassure you that the Reading for Healing course will be back, although one of the tutors has now left, we have others who are keen to co-deliver the course and we hope it will feature in the Autumn Prospectus.

"158","Beckj4","Patients at a secure hospital have been involved in a new project called'my Never Ending Story'. This is a tale of recovery. It’s written by the patients together in the style of a fairy tale – but it encompasses many aspects of their or their peer’s lives. The difficulties may have been observed in others or felt by themselves. It is humorous and over the top at times, it was written in that way. What started as a task grew into an enthusiasm and the characters took on a life of their own. As you are drawn into this tale listen to the journey that the characters are taking. All of them are learning to cope with difficulties. All of them have some difficulty with prejudices and communication – whether through understanding a different language, paranoia concerning others opinions of them or just because they are different in appearance.
This tale could be written and re written because it is not the story of just one community……………..it could be any community and is happening in different ways all the time hence the never-ending story. As one recovers and accepts a new life another’s journey begins…………………….
Patients spent nearly two years putting together this fantasy story based on the recovery model. The story is fun but with a serious message. The stage the backdrops and all the puppets have been created by a group of four (sometimes five) patients and staff. They are very proud of their work and are looking forward to the forthcoming performances.
This is a piece from a patient:
I was asked to help out with building and design of the models and anything I could help with. I was asked what was the best material to use modroc or papier mache. Modroc is too heavy so papier mache was agreed on and off we went into the designing and building.
My work then began with the building of Joe the paper boy, Spyro the pig, the bed mattress, sheet, quilt and pillow, cooker, menu, book Recovery planter, Joe’s paper bag, cat cage, tablet x 2, certificates, the ring and the wedding arch and removable moon.
It has slowly taken it’s time to get to where we are now, the performance was fantastic from my point of view. To hear staff and patients applauding at the ending of each act and being congratulated at the end.
To see how the play came about and to see how a simple Recovery of a fictional character and all others, I. e. Spyro, Joe, Judge, Father Abraham, Lofty, Mum, Papa Frog, the Police Officer.
I have taken up some blogging for The Unit Flow and The Carers Magazine.

So please come along, laugh and cry if you want but please enjoy.
I split my script up into Act 1, end of Act 1, Act 2 end of Act 2.
We were given long sleeved black T Shirts, due to the T Shirts being too small, I had a Billy Connelly extension added on for extra effect.","RHANottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustRHANG3 6AANottinghammental health trust","Today","a staff member","87899","Mary Lilley, Modern Matron, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Mary Lilley, Modern Matron, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust I would like to congratulate all our patients for all their hard work in the production of the 'Never ending Story'.

This is a piece by one of the patients:
For the past 14 months, I have been involved in making the models, backdrops and props for the Never Ending Story. I began making Nippimuki the frog and the judge. We made them using papier mache with a plastic milk bottle inside for support, which I found a bit messy and shaky. I was glad once they were dry and I could paint them. I enjoyed seeing the characters emerge. It was funny seeing the words turn into characters. We all got very involved in the story and wanted a positive outcome. Everyone was very ‘hands on’ and enthusiastic, we all enjoyed the moment when the story came to life.
I also got involved in deciding where and what backdrops we needed. I painted two backdrops—the smashed up pumpkin one and the Hard Rock Café. The café backdrop was very detailed and involved some collage work, as well painting.
After all the backdrops and props were completed, I was involved n the performance. It was exciting to see the backdrops, figures and performance all come together. My part in the performance was to help move the backdrops into position and add sound effects for the characters (not dogs though). We eventually filmed our performance and are now waiting for the Recovery Day—Grass is Greener Where it’s Watered, for our last performance.
Towards the end of rehearsals it was suggested performers might like black T Shirts to present a uniform appearance. These were duly ordered, but when they arrived were found to be a tad on the small side. The Art Department added a few feet of fabric and the fitted much better.","RHANottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustRHANG3 6AANottinghammental health trust","Today","a staff member","87898","Mary Lilley, Modern Matron, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Mary Lilley, Modern Matron, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust I would like to congratulate all our patients for all their hard work in the production of the 'Never ending Story'.

The stage the backdrops and all the puppets have been created by a group of four (sometimes five) patients and staff. They are very proud of their work and are looking forward to the forthcoming performances.
This is a piece from a patient:
I was approached by staff from CRB at the end of 2012 and asked if I could help with the production of the Never Ending Story play, which was at the stage of Production and needed patients to help other peers and staff to help the smooth running of the play.
My initial impression was one of skepticism in that this would be a flop as trying to put on a play with constant problems with security. When I attended CRB Art Room the first time and read the story, seen puppets and all the work patients and staff had put into this project, inspired me to do my best to help them put the show on. I felt quite honored to help this story get told in a humourous way, knowing it’s a reflection of true events and patients will familiarise themselves with some of the story I wan in.
I was given the task of doing all the backdrops and working out a smoother way to change the near scenery on cue. This took a few weeks to do and eventually, we chose cue words being the best method to allow me to change the backdrops on cue with the story line. This worked. Cards were made and cue words were placed on the cards for 6 Acts. When the story was read, I only had to listen to these key words to change each backdrop. The only difficulty I had was having to use some of the same backdrops twice. Not having much room to move and having staff Andy to construct a jig to allow the backdrops to go in and also to alter the stage slides to make the smoother process of putting backdrops in and out.
I had a peer to help me put the backdrops away during each change to save time and allow me to focus on listening to my cue words. I made a suggestion that at the front of the stage a large picture of a pumpkin should go there to hide the performers feet and give views a laugh before the curtain goes up.
We all spent a considerable amount of time rehearsing for the first opening show. For me, I was a little nervous but also excited at the prospect of this show being aired for an audience instead of a rehearsal. At our first show there was a mishap, leading to a large crash, just before Act 7. This led to laughter and added to the comedy of the production.
Since this first production we did a further two productions and also recorded the play. Getting positive feedback and hearing viewers laughter gave me a buzz. With a sense of satisfaction that all the hard work of staff and patients was a job well done. For me it was a pleasure to be a part of this production.","RHANottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustRHANG3 6AANottinghammental health trust","Today","a staff member","87897","Mary Lilley, Modern Matron, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Mary Lilley, Modern Matron, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust I would like to congratulate all our patients for all their hard work in the production of the 'Never ending Story'.

I also had experience of the District Nurse Service concerning my Mum. She became ill at home in Skegness and was taken to Lincolnshire hospital. Mum was in hospital for many weeks and lost so much weight and her leg ulcers which she'd had for over 4 years were no better. So I decided to bring Mum home to Cotgrave into Eton Park care home where I could keep a close eye on her.
The district nurses attended mum's ulcerated legs and within 8 weeks her ulcers had healed really well. It was great to see as it had been a few years since I had seen her without bandages on both legs.
These nurses worked wonders with Mum, I had not seen her so well for a while. Unfortunately Mum contracted shingles followed by pneumonia and died in hospital.
I would like to say a huge thank you to all they did for Mum and for giving the family a chance to see her so well, which is how we now remember her.","302-community-nursingCommunity nursingRHARHA20service","Last six months","a relative","87774","Health PartnershipsHealth PartnershipsI’m very sorry to hear about the loss of your Mum, but thank you for your kind words of appreciation regarding the community nursing service at Cotgrave.

I would suspect that if you missed the early drinks round this may have been due to you still being asleep as the staff would not necessarily wake a patient to offer a drink unless they were asked by the patient to do so - not everyone appreciates being woken early even for a cup of tea and so staff have to make a decision on each morning.
Patients can always ask a member of staff for a drink at any point of the day or night and one will be made - the ward has a kitchen and has access to hot and cold drinks and snacks 24 hrs a day - I will share this with all of the wards so the staff can understand that it is important to check with a patient if they would like to be woken for a drink in the morning or not, so we can avoid and confusion.

Working with people who have kindness, understanding and respect has been very helpful.
Mary my OT was a person who I could connect with, who visited my home and I was able to contact whenever I needed to. She helped me to think about my interests and my options for the future and ambitions. She referred me to the Social Inclusion and Wellbeing Team and I met with OT Rachel and my volunteer co-ordinator, who are amazing people and have a lot of experience.
It is important to look at a person fully, where they have been in the past, what they have been through, what they want in the present and what are their hopes and abilities for the future.

Whilst frontline services are being affected deeply by the current cuts across many services in the country, it is important to remember that there are other voluntary services that exist that have a strong track record of supporting patients with regards to their personal development and well being.
Whilst I am not suggesting that the voluntary sector takes up the strain, and are also affected by the current economic climate, there are still opportunities in the community for patients to receive support.

"194","reets1","Staff are very kind, I can't praise them highly enough. They are cheerful, good humoured, never nasty, a little uppish sometimes nothing to complain about. The quality of care is good, but they don't give you enough information. Why is the NHS run on paracetamol? It's not strong enough. I was waiting for two days before the doctor wrote it up.
I waited ages for the lunch to be delivered, and the in my opinion the food is the biggest let down. There is too much - all veg on the plate - and the bread and butter pudding would mend a hole in a dam! I had to wait til everyone else had left the table before I could leave the table, and my son was visiting. Drinks are good, and they change the water several times a day. It is too hot on the ward, though - my lips have peeled about 4 times.
You sometimes have to wait a bit for staff to come to help you, there aren't enough of them. I'm not dissatisfied with the care though, would just like a bit more information and not just paracetamol for pain. I'm grateful, I'm cared for and it's all for nothing. I don't think it should be for nothing, we should pay.","RHANN-inpatientInpatient nursing and rehabilitationRHANG2 6PRRHA20service","Last six months","the patient","85368","Sara Jane Ashmore, Head of Inpatient Nursing Services, County Health PartnershipsSara Jane Ashmore, Head of Inpatient Nursing Services, County Health PartnershipsThank you for posting your thoughts regarding your care received by the team on John Procter ward. I am glad you feel that overall you have had good care.But I am sorry that you felt you were not given enough information, could you expand a little more on this as I am not clear what information you wanted and I would like to be able to review how the information is given by the staff so we can ensure that we are doing the best we can in all cases.
I am sorry that you felt your only pain relief was paracetamol as the clinical team managing your care would have a wide range of painkillers to choose from if they knew that the paracetamol was not working well for you - there are many reasons why the paracetamol may have been the best or only appropriate option for you personally, but I am concerned that you waited 2 days for a prescription to be written by the team. Your care was managed by a nurse practioner and a doctor who are both on site monday to friday and we have out of hours medical cover and so there should be no reason for you to have had to wait - I will discuss this with the ward manager to see if we can see why this happened to you.
I appreciate that the ward may have felt too warm for you, this is always a difficult one to get right for everyone as many patients feel the cold and want the heat turned up at this time of the year, we do try to keep it as regulated as possible by general feedback from patients and visitors in order that we can meet the majority of needs.
I have passed your comments regarding the food to the catering team here at the hospital, and the ward team as they plate the food at mealtimes. I am sorry that you felt the food was too much for you and there were too many vegetables on your plate, we do try to ensure a balanced meal and aim to give appropriate portion sizes where possible.It is always ok to ask for a little less food the staff would much sooner give patients what they want rather than patients feeling they can't eat their meal as there is too much food for them.
I appreciate that waiting until last to leave the table can be frustrating and the staff do try to make sure that this is done as fairly as possible, - if the staff are aware that a family member is waiting to see you they will always try to see you you first where they can.
I undertsand it can be frustrating to have to wait for a member of staff to come to you on occasions, I hope to reassure you that any delay is due to the fact that staff will be with another patient and will come to you as soon as is possible.
To reassure you the staffing levels are reviewed on a constant basis and are at safe levels for the servcie we provide at present.
I will pass this to the team on the ward and the ward sister and I will discuss in more detail the issues you have rasied to see how we may further improve our care delivery and I thank you again for taking the time to repsond as it really does make a difference and allows us the opportuinty to keep learning and improving services.85509County Health PartnershipsRHA20853682013-02-08T13:21:28.85po","Conditionrehabilitation","care on John Proctor ward","","2013-02-07T21:11:19.36","","po"

"198","louspins","I would like to share my experience of breastfeeding and the value of breastfeeding supporters. I am a mother of 3 and have breastfed all my children, my first for a year my second for 3 years and my third had his last bedtime milk from me on his 5th birthday, so I consider myself an experienced breastfeeder. It is not always an easy ride, far from it, in the early days it can be a very overwhelming experience and this is where I feel breastfeeding peer supporters really do make an incredible difference. To be able to share your worries with someone else that has been there and done it really can help and encourage mum's to keep going. It helps to hear that your not alone and someone else felt like that too, that babies do that and its quite normal and the little tweaks that could make a big difference, a classic example, not pressing on the breast to see if baby is attached so 9 times out of 10 they have then pulled baby to the end of the nipple when they were probably on right! !
My worse experience of breastfeeding believe it or not was with my 3rd baby, we just could not get it together, how could I get it so wrong when I had already had 4 years of my life doing it already. I could not get him latched on properly, I got incredibly sore, had mastitis as we continued to do it wrong and the first 2 months were really not a pleasant experience at all. I was then asked to a community health meeting with the then new Sure Start team in our area, when asked what was needed I immediately said we need a breastfeeding support group. Being a rural area we had never had one before and there was no support at all close by. I was asked if I would be prepared to be trained as a peer supporter and help get the group set up and running and I jumped at the chance. We put a lot of hard work into getting the group off the ground, advertising in local school advertising boards, local GP surgeries, Local chemist's and health centres and sitting in with the midwife on her antenatal classes. This really paid off and before long we were running a really busy group with good results and feedback too, proving what a difference we could make. In our second year we had mum's coming back with their next babies.
We always welcomed the whole family, dad's, grandma's and siblings, when we had siblings in we would make sure we had activities put out for them to do giving mum chance to speak to us if she needed too. What was always a big highlight for us too was the support within the group grew and the mum's themselves would share and swap stories to help and encourage others. This also had a big impact on how long the mum's would continue to feed, many of them feeding for far longer than they had planned. I believe mum's often will listen and respect what is being said from a mum to mum perspective rather than being told by a health professional, obviously they are the experts and peer supporters who are trained know how to work within their boundaries but peer support just seems to work to encourage mum's to carry on so well.
I was then fortunate enough to be offered a position being a paid peer supporter in a pilot scheme being run in Derbyshire. Initially this was very hard work as we were not introduced particularly well but once all the other midwives and health visitors could see how valuable we could be and a difference we could make we got called upon more and more and after a time the results really started to come through. We worked in the community and went in on day 2 and 4 after discharge on home visits and when needed after, but this was also backed up by phonecalls if needed. We also ran a 24 hour helpline which was very well used and we all took a turn in the team to man the phone.
As always in life circumstances change and unfortunately my dad was taken ill so I had to leave my paid peer support as I then became a paid carer as part of my dad's care. I was fortunate though as I could still continue my voluntary work in Ashfield which I did so for 3 and a half years until once again circumstances changed again and my dad was taken into hospital and I then needed to find paid work to help support my family. I then had to make one of the most upsetting decisions as I had to leave my voluntary post too which I had worked very hard with for all that time, years of work, the group, which was very successful, I had also attended district and county health meetings and been part of the team that put together the peer support program which is now running in Nottinghamshire, I was gutted to no longer be a part of that, this is something that I do so well, and I just hope and pray that some day in the future we will get that vital funding to be able to pay peer supporters in Nottinghamshire so that they can continue to do an incredibly valuable job but have the chance to make a career of it.
One of my proudest moments was knowing my babies were thriving and growing well and that was all down to me. Nature gave us the tools and I used them well and if I could give someone else the chance to do the same for their baby what a special gift that would be.","261-sure-startSure StartRHANG21 0HJRHA20Mansfieldservice","Last year","the patient","85002","Jenny Newman, Patient, Carer and Public Engagement Manager, Health Partnerships - Nottinghamshire HealthcareJenny Newman, Patient, Carer and Public Engagement Manager, Health Partnerships - Nottinghamshire HealthcareThanks for taking the time to share your story, it is fascinating to see how each breastfeeding relationship can be so different, and the difference that breastfeeding support can make to you individually and as a family.

"200","Janzq3","Befriending at Arnold Lodge: A Volunteer’s Perspective
I was very keen to undertake voluntary work at Arnold Lodge after my retirement. So I was pleased to have the opportunity to become a volunteer in a befriending scheme set up by Jo Rapson, Voluntary Services Manager, Forensic Division, and Jennie Palmer-Vines, Therapy Services Manager, Arnold Lodge. I was very aware of the need for such a scheme. Not long before my retirement, I facilitated a patient satisfaction survey, which found that 31% of patients were rarely or never visited (Arnold Lodge 2010).
At first, it was strange returning to Arnold Lodge in a very different role, and I found myself automatically reaching for non-existent keys to get through doors! It was interesting to experience Arnold Lodge as a visitor. Thanks to everyone who has made me feel very welcome, both the two people I have started to “befriend”, and managers and staff of different disciplines. Safety and security at Arnold Lodge remain excellent, but I’ve wondered if some visitors might find the number and content of security notices forbidding, even though this is not intended.
The amount of thought that has gone into setting up the befriending scheme is very apparent. I attended an excellent training day, where we were encouraged to think about the befriender’s role, in relation to safety and relationships with befriendees, including the maintenance of boundaries. The training was very well delivered, and encouraged reflection.
It was good to have an initial meeting set up by Jennie Palmer-Vines, and attended by each of the people that I visit, and to discuss items in a contract. This makes clear, to both patient and befriender, the role of both in the relationship; and the need for the befriender to report to staff anything that patients have said about harming themselves or others, or about their mental or physical health.
I started visiting in November, 2012. How have the visits progressed? Well, only the patients can judge this. I have recognised the need for consistency and reliability: to be available to visit regularly, provided the patients concerned still want this. There is also a need to be self-aware, and to avoid a relationship that is patronising; and a need to be relaxed and informal, whilst, at all times, maintaining awareness of safety and the maintenance of boundaries. I look forward to my future befriending visits.

I am sure that the patients you are matched with also enjoy and appreciate your visits. Befriending is a positive experience for our patients and it often makes a big difference in their quality of life knowing that someone is coming to visit them regularly and really value the fact that you choose to spend time with them, rather than being under a professional or family obligation to do so.

Pizza massage is a way of explaining to young children how to do a range of massage moves on others like kneading the dough (kneading the skin using flat knuckles) or sprinkling on the cheese (use fingertips). This would be a great way to encourage toddlers in positive touching and to form a closer bond with a younger sibling. It may also give a sense of pride in being able to undertake that role and responsibility to be gentle (with supervision!)
I have spoken to a member of staff and he has a plan on how to take that idea forward.

Following on from the idea you initiated, the team have now got a plan to put into action to bring about change
The workers who deliver the baby massage provision have got together to look at incorporating this concept and have come up with a plan.
During baby massage course; the workers are going to start to introduce pizza massage and also weather massage ideas to the parents; discussing benefits of older siblings becoming involved with massaging – bonding; emotions; nurturing and building good and positive relations amongst own family and also encouraging parents to allow this to happen – addressing and overcoming any concerns/worries around getting older siblings involved.
This will happen throughtout the 3wks of delivery, culminating in the final week with providing leaflets/info about what has been discussed and showing techniques to use.
This may elicit further requests for additional information/help from parents regarding applying pizza massage techniques at home which could further lead to one-off sessions etc totally devoted to pizza massage.
Thank you for generating this idea for us. it is always good to get feedback and ideas from the local community so we can shape services to meet local needs87780Health Partnerships - Nottinghamshire HealthcareRHA20842622013-02-28T13:36:48.937po","Proceduregroup","'Pizza Massage'","","2013-01-29T15:44:05.357","","po"
"202","Daniz4","My baby was a few weeks old. I had received the information about the group from the ante natal classes and once my husband was back at work; it was a matter of 'let's do it, ' let's go. ' It felt a very hard thing to do in those early weeks, as a first time mum, but so glad I plucked up the courage and can honestly say I've never looked back.
My baby and I have always been made to feel very welcome, have enjoyed the play activities and have been encouraged to suggest new things we want to try. It's a time for me to make friends, chat to other parents and to discover that we all do things differently and that's ok if if baby is content, happy and healthy. It's a time I can really focus on my baby, how she is developing, her interests and to give her a good start in becoming a sociable, confident individual. The group has been a life line - proving to be invaluable.
I have worked in childcare for many years, run similar groups and now am seeing it all from the other side. I feel I can ask for advice and support from the other side. I feel I can ask for advice and support from the workers that run the group, without feeling that a question is silly, that I am anxious or that I should know, as I would do with family, colleagues and close friends. The staff also take a genuine interest in all the babies and are so natural with them.
The qualifications and experience from working in childcare may have given me the theory but nothing has prepared me for the emotional feelings, the adaptions to the change parenthood brings and how overwhelming it is when I suddenly realised my life has been turned upside down and will never be the same again.
Under Ones has been the medicine I've needed, enjoying the time it gives me with my baby - my little friend.

I want to get fit and have a few pounds to lose, so it's great to be able to make meals for the whole family and not just for me.
And as if that wasn't enough, I also got a load of money off vouchers, including a free 2 litre bottle of Cravendale milk. What more could I want? !

"205","SIWT","Library Services in Nottingham City have been working in partnership with the Social Inclusion and Wellbeing Team to provide volunteering opportunities for service users. The St Anns, Meadows, Hyson Green and the City Central Library have a number of services they provide to benefit the community. They have taken on volunteers to help with the conversation groups, the language café and homework clubs. The conversation groups and language café brings people together from all backgrounds, cultures and countries with the common aim of learning English through conversations. Through enjoying casual chatting people in the groups not only improve their English but also gain self-confidence and engage with the wider community. Nottingham is a multi-cultural city and programmes such as these encourage a sense of community spirit and unity as people come together with a mutual goal to learn English in a fun, relaxed and inclusive atmosphere. The conversation groups provide additional support to those who English is not their first language, by giving people a place to talk, share and make friends from all different backgrounds. There are increasing numbers of asylum seekers who are using mental health services due to traumas, which they have experienced and many have been signposted to these groups as an aid to their recovery. The Social Inclusion and Wellbeing Team can support service users to gain and work through volunteering opportunities such as at the Libraries. If required support workers can help through the initial stages of volunteering, until the support is no longer needed.
The Social Inclusion and Wellbeing Team have highlighted the lack of service provision in the area of arts and crafts and the Library Services have responded by rolling out arts and crafts activities and wellbeing sessions from March onwards in different libraries Nottingham especially at Clifton library.","RHANottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustRHANG3 6AANottinghammental health trust","Today","a volunteer/advocate","84059","Julie Grant, Head of Communications, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustJulie Grant, Head of Communications, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustDear SIWT

Thank you for raising this concern with us. I think that if I had had the experience you describe, I would be asking the exact same question myself.
I'm one of the Patient Opinion team and responsible for the security of the website and the confidentiality of your information. Stories on Patient Opinion are moderated by a small number of people in our team, each of whom takes your confidentiality very seriously.
The only information we hold which could identify you is your email address, and your post code. We never, ever, share this information with anyone outside Patient Opinion without your explicit consent, and we never will.
Sometimes, though, we do hear of cases where staff read a story on Patient Opinion and try to guess who the author is. Sometimes, the guess is right, and sometimes wrong. Of course, the more unusual the experience you describe, the bigger the chance someone will know about it and guess right. That may be what happened here.
We can't do anything about people trying to guess the identity of authors - but we do spend a lot of time with health service staff, focusing always on ""what can we do better?"" and not on ""who wrote this about us?""
I hope that reassures you - but do feel free to respond if you still have concerns about this.84226Patient Opinion840522013-01-29T09:29:01.087poJulie Grant, Head of Communications, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustJulie Grant, Head of Communications, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustDear Fubar
James is correct - because the wording of your posting on Patient Opinion and your more formal letters to the Trust were so similar we took an educated guess that you were the source of each message.
James is also correct in that we have never tried to find out information about who has posted and Patient Opinion has never shared that with us. We respect your confidentiality.
We find Patient Opinion to be an excellent method of capturing feedback, whether good or bad, and we hope that our assumptions about you don't put you off using this less formal and real time method of letting us know what you think about our services.

"207","Concernedme","My care on Rowan 2 was variable. Most of the staff were lovely and supportive. However one staff member was very rude to both myself and my carer.
My carer was treated with contempt as he informed the staff member of one of my risks. They responded ""We expect patients to take responsibility for their own safety.""
I was later told by this member of staff that I was wasting their time and everyone else's, and that I wasn't even trying to get better. They then told me I should just discharge myself and go home. When I tried to do this I was put on a section 5(2).
When I was re-admitted at a later date they wouldn't acknowledge my existence and ignored me even when they were serving dinner.
I was also not told of any plans to discharge me until I was sat in the discharge meeting. I was told ""We have cured your depression, you just have personality disorder. You can pick up your medication in a couple of hours and then go home, your community mental health team will contact you next week sometime to organise support."" 
I was not told anything else and was left with no information. They'd been so quick to diagnose me with a personality disorder, then stopped caring. It was later discovered I was misdiagnosed and had actually been suffering from a psychotic episode with Bipolar, and had received inappropriate treatment as a result of their assumptions.","RHA_710Adult mental healthRHANG3 6AARHA_710serviceRHA_710iInpatient mental health careRHANG3 6AARHA_710iservice","More than a year ago","the patient","83945","Julie Grant, Head of Communications, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustJulie Grant, Head of Communications, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustDear Concernedme

It created a time for the patients on the ward to pass on some creative comments and enjoy a cup of tea and cake whilst our new volunteers collated the information. Thanks to all the patients who passed on their thoughts and comments.
In answer to the remark around the pool table, we do not have our own pool table true but Rowan 1 ward are happy if possible for Rowan 2 staff to access their pool table for a period of time. We found that on the whole a ladies ward did not have enough pool table users for us to have our own.
Regarding the potato based products, baked potatoes are an option but it may only be once a week. Also cereal options for breakfasts are unfortunately restricted to Weetabix, Rice Crispies and Cornflakes by our ordering Suppliers. However there is always a hot option of porridge, beans, or tomatoes (and at weekends Bacon or Sausage). If someone wished to bring in their own Muesli or similar items then there is room to store these for them.
Finally to discuss the showers all Rowan 2’s showers are on a timer switch and can at sometimes be quite frustrating. I have asked Rowan 2’s environment co-ordinator to discuss with Highbury Healthcare Estates department to see if in any way the timer’s can be altered. Hopefully if your shower is not working correctly, then make the staff aware and they can get an engineer as soon as is possible to come and try to fix your shower for you.

"215","Rambuie","It might not be anything that any professional staff would be in the least bit concerned about, but I seek to draw wider attention to an issue which deeply troubles me.
It relates to an agenda which is becoming prevalent at Healthcare trusts, an agenda which is actively hostile to the very prominent and effective role which art and creativity has hitherto played in the lives of people who seek to make progress, restitution and an eventual recovery of their skills which have fallen into disuse as a result of incapacitating, severe mental ill-health and which needs the multi-disciplinary approach of skilled practitioners working therapeutically and remedially with patients to restore these lost abilities and re-engage with their talents in art, music, writing and related media engagement of a therapeutic nature.
Our chief executive makes great play of scientific finesse which does the professionals engaged in healthcare credit. But it is deeply unhelpful to devalue the contributions made by the applied talents and human skills of artists, whose gifts do not lie in laboratories but in more natural living settings, bringing genuine progress and lifting the spirits of a demoralised and besieged patient clientele.
I evidence my concern on recent developments which over the last five years have seen the Broad Street centre broken up and dissolved, leaving a dismantled community of therapy delivery which took many years to assemble, without a base for creative activity, rendering the relic of this which was the Social Inclusion and Well-being service non-functional and now under attack as many practitioners are now discarded and made redundant from giving service to their clients. While the out-come for this service is shameful, I believe it is the thinking behind under-valuing what the Arts can bring as a contribution to improving health as a vehicle for recovery which is greatly at fault.
I would urge the people who have such uninformed power over us to reconsider their actions before any further decimation of these services is brought to bear. We are individuals with individual talents and fortunately, we are not all the same. So the diversity of the services is vital to meet diverse needs and essential for many people who now feel under siege.
I hope that by bringing this to your attention we can foster a greater regard for all the hands which have manned the pumps of progress in mental healthcare.","RHA_710Adult mental healthRHANG3 6AARHA_710service","Unknown","the patient","83668","Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Thank you for your feedback which we appreciate.

You will have seen previous postings about our Wellbeing and Social Inclusion Service. We do not disagree with you that the arts can contribute to improving health. In the current economic climate however, we have had to make some difficult decisions in relation to our cost improvement programme and some services have had to be changed. We are supporting the Nottingham Focus on Well-being group to develop an Arts provision in the community - which I can put you in touch with. Nottingham Focus on Wellbeing can be contacted at nottingham-focus-on-wellbeing@live.co.uk

Service Manager86892Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust RHA836682013-02-20T16:08:11.323poRambuieRambuieGreetings, Jane. 
Having drawn a number of short straws regarding genuine support for artistic pursuits and coming from a direction with experience which focuses on continuing ill-health, I might struggle to communicate from cold, with people whose ethos is to look after the 'well'. 
However we are not incapable of taking some initiatives, so where the door of an ongoing opportunity to submit pictures and publicly show-case creativity has been closed to us, I have been clearing a threshold to open on a fresh opportunity from the grass-roots via lottery funding in the independent sector and in partnership with volunteers. T
his is still in its formative stages, because you will appreciate, the whims and partialities of the powers that be are a law to themselves - and others are not privy to them until after the fact - so there is a time-lapse before we can step in and remediate where it is most needed. 
What I can say is that the people most strongly convinced of the value of Arts and Health agendas are voting with our feet and seeing to it that what we need does continue to happen. The real regret is that we have to chase up these resources, when there is no funding for us ourselves to pursue our strengths and see to it that we are meaningfully occupied to everyone's best advantage.
So with the courage of my convictions, some of this agenda will continue to happen, but never on the scale to meet the needs of a clientele of 10,000 in the County and 3,000 in the City - and that is only for the people with my diagnosis! 
Much is lost, but all is not lost, then.86904836682013-02-20T21:34:14.99po","ConditionbrokenConditiondelivery","The importance of arts in health care","","2013-01-23T16:22:11.973","","po"

The main point I want to make however is one of the panel a lady called Anne said that men seem to be over looked in mental health and for treatment. This has got me wondering why services don't do more for men...... Is it that men just run off to the pub.... Get more aggressive and angry and then not get the service that they require?
There are lots of groups for women. I am wondering if notts healthcare trust could do some work around involving men more and helping men to survive longer and better.
I don't know of any successful men's groups. I know that the Nottingham recovery college do run courses for women.
I am thankful that at least one person realises that men don't face mental health problems well.","RHA_710Adult mental healthRHANG3 6AARHA_710serviceRHA_710iInpatient mental health careRHANG3 6AARHA_710iservice","Today","the patient","83346","Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Thank you so much for sharing your story.

"223","Xsmithx","I live in Kirkby in Ashfield and when I started going to Sure Start I often wondered why other parents from my street didn't access Sure Start centres.
Then when I became a volunteer for Sure Start I wanted to help to try and see why parents wouldn't come to the group. When Sure Start did a event on the park on my street and it was successful, I came up with a list of ideas that we could do on the park so the parents could have like a toddler group and Marie and the child care workers also do a group for 5-12 year olds after school where they recently did a play to show to parents and other Sure Start staff members.
I gave this list to one of the family health and support workers that was going to set up a group on Mayfield street. The group has been running since September and I have been gathering some feedback from parents off the street.
I asked them some questions:
1. Why didn't you attend any sure start groups until Mayfield group started?
2. Are you enjoying the group and if so what do you like about it?
3. what would you like sure start to do in the future on Mayfield street?
4. if there was any courses to run down on the street what would you like?
Here's the answers I got to the questions:
1. I could go to groups because I am a career for my disabled husband as well as look after my kids. Its too far to walk, I feel uncomfortable going to groups on my own, my working hours change from 1 week to the next, groups start to early in a morning and when my little girl is at nursery in afternoon and group is in a morning its hard to get home after a group and walk up to nursery in time.
2. I enjoy it because its only over the road, my kids love it, the older kids have got a good relationship with staff, I like it because I don't have to walk far and everyone is really friendly.
3. I would like to see a group for 12+, the 5-12 group to be on for bit longer other than an hour and more events on the park.
4. I would like a child care course to do if its only across park, craft course and any course that you can get to do down here.
These answers are from 4 parents that live on the street and access the Mayfield group. For me, to do what the staff has done is amazing and is benefiting the children on the street. It is slowly making the street into a fantastic little community.","261-sure-startSure StartRHANG21 0HJRHA20Mansfieldservice","Last six months","the patient","82555","Karon Foulkes, General Manager, Sure Start, Health Partnerships - Nottinghamshire HealthcareKaron Foulkes, General Manager, Sure Start, Health Partnerships - Nottinghamshire HealthcareThank you for letting us know about the impact of the work of the Sure Start team on Mayfield Street.

"225","breastfriend","As a SureStart Peer Support Volunteer I'm now able to go onto the Maternity Ward at King's Mill Hospital to ask Breastfeeding mums if they would like a phone call to see how they are getting on with Breastfeeding when they have left hospital. We aim for this to be within 72 hours of them getting home. This is for a mum to mum chat and try and answer any questions and concerns they may have about Breastfeeding. It is also to tell them about the Breastfeeding Groups, known as BreastFriends in their nearest SureStart Childrens Centre. This is where we can offer one to one support, they can sit and chat to other mums, make new friends and see friendly faces. Most of all make them feel they are not on there own. They can use the group as a drop in or attend every week so its very easy going and calm surroundings.
It has taken a few weeks to settle down going into the Hospital as a SureStart Volunteer getting to know some of the staff and on the whole it has gone very well. I'm enjoying it and the consents for phone calls has risen which I'm very pleased about. I have had mums drop into the Breast Friends Group where I'm based, who I have spoken to in the hospital so I think this is fantastic.
On the downside to all this I have been a Peer Support Volunteer for eight years now, and when I'm talking to a mum in hospital I can only talk about the phone call and what to expect from it, fill in the consent form with her details for the call. It really upsets me when they ask a question, or might be feeding infront of me and I can't give them any advice there and then. I can talk to them on the phone within the next few days but not when they need it. I do fetch a midwife to them but they can be very busy.
I'm not classed as a Hospital Volunteer and need to go through more checks and hospital training but this could be difficult. I don't have the time to do this as it doesn't fit in with school times like all my training which I do with SureStart. I love what I do and hope I'm making a diffrence in my community but I only have limited amount of time to give. I think this Service run by volunteers is boosting the Breastfeeding figures and even if a mum feeds for just one more day making a diffrence to the mum and baby. I think there should be abit more understanding between the Hospital and what SureStart Childrens Centres are trying to offer, but realising that Volunteers have commitments and limited amount of time.","261-sure-startSure StartRHANG21 0HJRHA20MansfieldserviceRK5BC_501Maternity careRK5NG17 4JTRK5BCservice","Last six months","a volunteer/advocate","82482","Jenny Newman, Patient, Carer and Public Engagement Manager, Health Partnerships - Nottinghamshire HealthcareJenny Newman, Patient, Carer and Public Engagement Manager, Health Partnerships - Nottinghamshire HealthcareThanks for taking the time to share your experience, it is great to hear about what you do as a volunteer.

"226","Andss2","So, here we are again. My daughter is four and a half months old, happy, healthy, beautiful. We’ve come a long way since the beginning of December – huge weight loss, projectile vomiting, colic, bacterial infection. 
And then it all stopped. She established a sleeping and eating routine which had become pretty reliable. I don’t remember my son ever having a routine for feeds – he was breastfed on demand and he demanded as and when he felt like it. My daughter is also breastfed on demand, but she demands at similar times each day – usually around 6am, again at around 8am, 11am, 2pm, 4. 30pm, 6pm and then cluster feeds until midnight. The evenings are hard work, but then we get six precious hours of uninterrupted sleep. Glorious.
This, it turns out, was a false sense of security. We’ve hit that growth spurt. The one we hit with my son at around the same age. My daughter, just like my son did before her, has today changed her routine. She has been feeding almost every hour today. The first inkling came at 3am when she woke for an extra feed. She still woke for her usual 6am and 8am feeds. And then she’s fed almost every hour throughout the day. She just can’t get enough milk today. I’m exhausted, just like I was when we went through this with my son. Only this time it’s different.
Last time around, I didn’t have a knowledgeable breastfeeding support network. I didn’t have any prior knowledge or experience and I didn’t have the confidence I have this time. Last time, people told me my son was a big baby and clearly he needed more than I could give him since he had started to feed so often. I was encouraged to start him on solids. He was almost five months old when we started to give him solids – just a teaspoon a day to begin with, until after he was six months old. I still breastfed him until he was just over two years old, but I started him on solids earlier than I wanted to.
This time around though, I have the knowledge, confidence and support. I attend my local Sure Start breastfeeding group, where there are women with children of all ages who all support each other. There are people there who know what it’s like and have been through the same. There’s Laura, the Breastfeeding Champion, who offers both practical and emotional support.
This time, I have the confidence to ride out this growth spurt and keep going with exclusive breastfeeding until six months before we start thinking about solids. I know my daughter is beginning to look forward to that time – she loves sitting at the table with us, and is showing lots of interest in the food on our plates, but this time I don’t feel that I need to bring that time forward.
And that’s why we need Sure Start Centres and why we need to fight to keep them. Breastfeeding rates in this country are not as high as they ought to be and they vary widely from area to area. There are lots of reasons women choose not to breastfeed, and there are lots of reasons women give up shortly after starting. If we take away the support networks that are in place, then more women will feel that they can’t begin or continue with breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is a natural process, but it is a learned process – it rarely happens by magic. Without a friendly, knowledgeable face to help when problems occur, to reassure, offer support, advise on technique, when needed, then the breastfeeding rates in this country will drop further.
Instead of taking away funding for breastfeeding support, we should be increasing the funding. We should be expanding the support networks, making it easier for new mothers to access the help they need in the first few days, when that support can mean the difference between a satisfying, fulfilling breastfeeding experience for mother and child, and a guilt-ridden one for a new mum who felt overwhelmed and didn’t know where to turn.
I feel lucky to have had the support my local Sure Start centre offers. I’m about to complete my training as a volunteer Breastfeeding Peer Supporter and I hope that I will be able to pass on some of this support in turn to another mother who needs some reassurance","261-sure-startSure StartRHANG21 0HJRHA20Mansfieldservice","More than a year ago","a parent/guardian","82460","Jenny Newman, Patient, Carer and Public Engagement Manager, Health Partnerships - Nottinghamshire HealthcareJenny Newman, Patient, Carer and Public Engagement Manager, Health Partnerships - Nottinghamshire HealthcareThanks so much for taking the time to share this experience, I hope you’re all feeling better now,

"227","Windblows","My mother has been a patient at Daybrook ward in the St Francis Unit at City Hospital, Nottingham since a transfer there from Bassetlaw hospital in Worksop in December 2012.
Due to poor communication, I have been left not knowing why all of a sudden a decision was made by the doctor to prevent me taking my mother out for up to an hour at a time to give her freedom to exercise and have fresh air.
Only my younger sister Kay is authorised to do this despite my previously having taken my Mum out for longer authorised outings such as to my sister's house in December 2012, which required 6 hours.
I was very distressed when prevented, without explanation, from taking my mother out a few days ago, and then being given a wrong extension number for the doctor not once but twice (different each time from different Daybrook nurses).
I only obtained the correct number after contacting PALS. Still no response from a communication with PALS, who said they had passed my tel numbers to the doctor.
The doctor has only ever talked to my sisters but never me. Why am I not being consulted at all about my part in my mother's care plan, when I am her most local and regular visitor at the hospital?
Why was the decision to exclude me from giving my mother the outings she needs to recuperate ever made? Also why is communication so impossible?","RHA_715Older people's mental healthRHANG3 6AARHA_715service","Yesterday","a carer","82451","Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust I was so sorry to hear the difficulties you have experienced regarding the communication and explanation around your involvement in your mother’s care.

Your reply does not acknowledge what the root of the problem was.

Unless it is stated that the doctor had made no mention on the forms of any exclusions for any relative, then the rectification has not been clearly made. To my mind, such possibilities of error are best prevented by making instructions as clear as possible.

In this case, the doctor's explanation was that staff on the ward had not understood the forms. In my opinion, this could be because of the format not being clear, undue assumptions or lack of clarity.83920824512013-01-25T12:37:56.003poHelen Smith, Community service manager/AHP lead, Nottinghamshire Healthcare  NHS TrustHelen Smith, Community service manager/AHP lead, Nottinghamshire Healthcare  NHS TrustHello,

The Social Inclusion and Wellbeing Service, that provides essential support and activities for many service users is being decimated, with many front-line staff being made redundant. Despite the fact that many of us rely on (and, dare I say it, enjoy) the groups run by SIWB, and despite the fact that they provide excellent value for money in terms of keeping sufferers well, stable and hence out of hospital, the service will cease without any consultation of interested parties.
This will have a seriously detrimental affect on the quality of my life and that of many others.

I am sorry that you feel so let down by our review of the Social Inclusion and Well Being Service. The decision to reduce this service is not one that was taken lightly and we have tried to make other provision for people to access support and opportunities in mainstream or third sector settings.
The decision to review the service has been going on for some time and implementation has been delayed due to the merger of the City and County AMH services. You are right to say that there is a financial element to the changes, but there is also a realisation that support for people’s wellbeing and recovery is not always dependant on a building. Some of the groups will continue. Tim Wood is leaving the Trust to found Nottingham Focus on Wellbeing (NFOW) which will host IT classes, English and Maths classes, a social drama group and a luncheon club.
The Recovery College is continually reviewing the courses it offers and also offers a safe social place for people to meet up and learn. The Recovery College can be accessed by people who want to attend courses and complete personal development learning plans. In addition our Involvement Centre has a host of social events and groups, linked to the involvement work they do that you may well enjoy. You are welcome to attend the Involvement Centre at any time to find out what is on offer. I know change is difficult and we appreciate your concerns but I hope you will try some of the other things on offer. We are still keen to support people in their recovery.
I hope this goes some way to reassure you.

Thank you for your response. I am not convinced or impressed by your arguments and would point out the following:
SIWB activities were unique. There is nothing else available specifically for mental health patients, that is ongoing and regular, in a suitable environment with staff experienced in mental health issues. Mainstream courses only last a few weeks each term and can be incredibly expensive. The third sector has lost a massive amount of funding and has cut it's own provision down to the bone, creative activities were among the first to be axed or became user-led and folded within months. (Users of these services are generally not well enough to take on the responsibility and pressure of leading a group and have to give up.)
You say ""support for people’s wellbeing and recovery is not always dependant on a building"". It might not be ""always"", but for many it is. Besides, it is not the building that is important to us but what goes on within it. The Involvement Team and the Recovery College both depend on a building (and one that has such disturbing associations for some that they cannot enter it), why are they the special case or can we expect them to be meeting al fresco soon?
Tim Wood and his FOCUS team are indeed doing a wonderful job and I know they would like to expand the activities they offer. But until they get the funding required that will not happen. I hope the Trust will do all it can to help and support FOCUS.
By axing the vital SIWB groups, you have effectively withdrawn our treatment and yet no-one in a management position has had the courtesy (and possibly the courage) to inform us in writing of this decision and the reasons for it. Instead it has been left to the soon to be redundant group leaders to break the news and sit with service users as they weep about the loss of their vital lifeline or try to explain to bewildered, vulnerable group members that there will no longer be activities for them to access.
Obviously service users were not consulted because you know what our response would be, as would be evident from our comments given at the so-called ""audit"" last year. And as my psychiatrist frequently points out the importance to my wellbeing of my attendance at the SIWB groups, I very much doubt that the clinicians at the sharp end of our care and treatment have been consulted either.
The Social Inclusion and Wellbeing Service has always been something of a Cinderella service within the Trust, being shoved from pillar to post in recent years. It has appeared that no-one in senior management has ever fully understood or appreciated the work the team do or the huge difference it makes to the quality of life and the wellbeing of so many service users.
Our mental health WILL suffer as a result of the Trust's decision. We just have to hope that you have not decided to axe all the inpatient beds and outpatient clinics when someone has to pick up the pieces.82481815892013-01-13T14:57:52.687poJane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Dear Fubar
I read your reply with concern and would like to invite you to get in touch with us to talk about the many issues raised in your posting.
There are several options of how you can do this:
1 Contact PALS (patient advice & liaison service) Freephone 0800 015 3367
2 Contact Complaints (service liaison) 0115 9934542
3 Contact Jane Marlow - City Service Manager 0115 9934586
4 Contact Nick Daibell - Adult Mental Health General Manager 0115 969 1300 -Ex 14111
We do appreciate you taking the time to tell us where services have not met your expectations and the impact on the lives of individuals. By receiving feedback whether it be good or bad this we can learn from the people who use our services and hear about what treatment and activities they value most.
I am very sorry you feel so unsupported by our Trust and I hope you take up the opportunity to discuss it in more detail and to share your opinions with key members of staff in our Trust.
Yours Sincerely

Sadly my anxiety is such that I have great difficulty communicating by telephone and will not be able to take you up on your suggestion. In any event, the proposed changes have already come into place in our services and I am seeing what I consider to be a detrimental impact on my mental health.
With regards to PALS, I also sent a comment on the closure of the group to PALS and received the following response
""Thank you for your email. I have liaised with the management of the area and have been informed that you have already received a comprehensive reply from the Chief Executive of Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, Patient Opinion and our Communications department. I'm afraid there is nothing further to add at this point.""
At that point I had not heard from the Chief Executive (I had to chase up this response), nor the Communications Department and most worryingly, I had always assumed comments posted on Patient Opinion were anonymous so was somewhat dismayed to see that my comments to PALS were assumed to be from the person on Patients Opinion. Or are the comments we post on here not anonymous?84051815892013-01-28T13:33:13.86po","Conditionmental health","Cuts to Social Inclusion and Well-Being Service","","2012-12-22T11:28:18.767","","po"

Thankyou for raising your concern
The Wells Road Centre has a policy in place which has been set up to control access to unsuitable material. PC's and Lap tops in particular are sophisticated devices and as technology changes constantly our ability to ensure that these are being used responsibly becomes difficult.
We do recognise that PC's can be useful and have therapeutic value. We have installed a PC on the ward for this reason which we are able to check and control access. This can be used for word processing and various other programmes and software including music and production. We also have a music studio which you are able to access as part of your activity plan.

Today for some reason has been a really bad day, so after struggling with the thoughts I rang for support. I told them of the thoughts that I was having and that I was struggling to cope. I took on board the suggestions that were made to me one of which was to go shopping to pass the time which I did.
The suicidal thoughts were not going away, in fact they were more intense than they were so came the dilemma: do I call again or just take my life?
So I did what I thought that people around me would say, and that was to pick up the phone again to say that I was still struggling with the thoughts and was having ideas of taking an overdose.
I didn't feel that they were listening to me, even though I had told them that I had brought the tablets to take. They suggested ways to keep busy, trying to reduce the thoughts.
Along with the thoughts to self harm and to overdose, I am now left feeling alone and let down.

"246","Janzq3","Posted on behalf of 'TOPHAT' at Oxford Corner open afternoon. Alcohol Awareness Week.
Some time ago I posted a story about my life and how services at Oxford Corner supported me through detox and associated health problems. After the detox I experienced symptoms of anxiety, lack of sleep and general focus and direction.
Today my life is totally back on track. I'm employing people again and working full time in my business as a builder.
My life has gone from strength to strength. Drink used to rule my life and now I'm still going to the pub. I'm not drinking alcohol but still enjoy the social side and my friends accept it. I've even able to go away with the lads and not drink.
Now I can actually visit my daughter who lives a distance away and the quality time I have with my daughter now really pleases me as she has only known me sober!
Oxford Corner has a self help group called 'Positive Outcomes' and I attend the group since I was discharged. We can ask for professional advice if issues are raised in the group that we may need support with. It's an anchor point and a natural progression in my recovery.","RHA-dual-diagnosisDual Diagnosis Team NottinghamshireRHANG1 5DURHA_721Nottinghamservice","Last two weeks","a service user","80451","Jackie Quenby, Deputy Alcohol Team Manager.

"252","Dolphin10","Alcohol Awareness Week - Oxford Corner Open Afternoon
The involvement team met ex drinker 'S' at the open afternoon.. 'S' shared her story of recovery in the hope that it will inspire others to seek help. 'S' nearly died from drink and has damaged her liver so much that drinking again could kill her.
She looks back at the days of her serious drinking and knows how close she came to literally dying for a drink.
“I’d always been a drinker, ” says 'S', “but when my mum died in my early 30s I started drinking heavily for comfort. I’d start with about six cans of lager in the evening and then move on to sparkling wine. I would drink on my own or when I had company, it didn't matter. My husband and daughter begged me to stop but I just carried on drinking.
“After a year I had an epileptic fit at work and split my head open. I was admitted to hospital and the doctor said the epileptic fit had happened because of my drinking. But when I got out I just carried on drinking too much alcohol. My life was chaotic. I hardly ate. I wasn't interested in anything except drink.
""Hard drinking turned my face yellow and my eyesight was so bad that I couldn't focus""
“After another year of hard drinking, my face turned yellow - known medically as jaundice - and my eyesight was so bad that I couldn't focus. These were both signs that something was badly wrong with my liver. I went to hospital and had tests, which showed that I had cirrhosis of the liver. The hospital health team said if I didn't stop drinking I would die.
“The nurses at the Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham saved my life. They detoxified me and motivated me to stay off the drink. They also made me realise what a fantastic family I have and that I needed to get better for them as much as for myself.
“I’ve stopped drinking now, but it was incredibly difficult. I’m eating a lot better and no longer have the shakes. These days, when I go to a pub, I just drink orange juice with lemonade. The awful thing is, I’ve got liver damage that will never go away and I know that if I drink again I could kill myself.
“It's possible to get your life back from drink. You need to get good medical help, that’s the first step. But I couldn’t have done it without my family. I regret all the time I missed with them, but we're definitely making up for it now. ”

What I feel Wathwood offers is a very much recovery focuses in-patient facility. The work that Wathwood is doing in terms of helping patients to move forward on their recovery journey is astounding.
I have had the opportunity to hear from staff and patients at Wathwood and have witnessed how staff and patients work so well together in supporting many of the initiatives in the unit.
It has been my absolute pleasure to have met many of the patients at Wathwood and I have been most impressed by their drive and positive attitude to recovery and moving forward.

"258","Xsmithx","My journey with started 5 years ago. I was 19 and was a career for my brother and sister. My mum put my name on the volunteers course. I didn't have a clue what sure start was all about. I completed my volunteers course and did a bit of volunteering but I decided not to do any more after a month of doing it as I just felt like I didn't fit in because I was young.
A few months later I fell pregnant, still living with my mum and four younger brothers and sisters. Life was pretty hard at that time.
When my midwife came to see me at 10 weeks pregnant and asked me how I was going to feed my baby I replied breast feeding is for older mums, I'm bottle feeding. At 30-32 weeks pregnant something clicked and I decided I was going to try and breast feed. I told my midwife and she just gave me a DVD to watch and nothing else was said about breast feeding. At 36 weeks I went to antenatal class, I was the youngest one there and felt really uncomfortable so I didn't attend the next 3.
By the time my son was 6 weeks old, I was really struggling with breast feeding, my baby wasn't sleeping and all he did all day and night was cry. I felt so alone and I had lack of support. Living with my mum was getting harder too. 
My midwife put me in contact with a breast feeding peer supporter and she met me before I went into the breast feeding group at the summer house. The peer supporters made feel very welcoming. There were all mature older mums that attended the group and I felt very lonely while I was in the group, as they talked about meeting up with each other and their husbands and going on expensive shopping trips. I felt like they looked down on me for being so young, there were a few comments made about people being on benefits etc., if I wasn't so stubborn then I would have not attended the group again. 
At 8 weeks, I had a home visit from a family health and support worker called Nina, who explained that she would support me through breast feeding and other obstacles that I was facing. I had the support for just over a year and if it wasn't for her I would have stopped breast feeding and not be as strong as I am now. When I felt really low or needed cry I knew Nina was just a phone call away.
When my little boy was 18 months old, I stopped feeding him myself and started a breast feeding peer support course. I wanted to do the course because I wanted to see younger mums like me breastfeed. It's been 2 years now since I did my breastfeeding support course and I have gone on to do other things. Jayne Gorewoda gave me the confidence boost I needed and enrolled me on the nvq level 3 child care. Working along side her a lot has made realise that she does a fantastic job and I now want to become a community development worker. Life is still hard as I volunteer all day most days, I look after my son and I am a career for my brothers and sister and 1 of my sisters is Autistic, so she is very challenging at times but with all the incredible support that I receive from Jayne and the team, it makes life a little easier.
I would like to see more support groups for the younger parents because they do get treated different by older parents. I see it happen in groups and it's still happening to me now. There are a lot of young parents in the community and I often ask my self why they aren't attending the Sure Start groups. I think it would be nice for more support from Sure Start during pregnancy. As a volunteer, I think it would be nice to see volunteers across the Ashfield district, they all do a fantastic job and it would be nice to meet them.
I am very proud to be a Sure start volunteer and work with fantastic staff. You have a brilliant bunch of staff members at Kirkby that inspire me so much.","261-sure-startSure StartRHANG21 0HJRHA20MansfieldserviceRK5BCKing's Mill HospitalRK5NG17 4JLRK5BCSutton-In-Ashfieldhospital","More than a year ago","a volunteer/advocate","79737","Jenny Newman, Patient, Carer and Public Engagement Manager, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustJenny Newman, Patient, Carer and Public Engagement Manager, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustThank you for taking the time to share your experience.

I was so pleased to read about the impact that working with Nina had on your confidence to breastfeed and about how Jayne has supported you into training and volunteering. Your commitment to volunteering is outstanding and I am sure the centre is benefitting from your expertise as a young parents and as carer of your sister. You will be pleased to know we do have volunteers throughout Ashfield District. I am really proud both of the number of active volunteers we have (over 130) and of the range of contributions they make to the success of Sure Start Childrens Centres. We also work closely with colleges to offer work experience and course input for a number of 14-17 year olds so they can learn about parenting, benefits of breastfeeding and working with children before they are parents.
I can see there are areas that we can improve on as well.
In terms of antenatal support for young parents, County Health Partnerships who are our employers, are running the Family Nurse Partnership programme for all first time pregnant teenagers from January next year. This will offer individual support on a regular basis from early pregnancy to 2 years. The FNP staff will be working closely with the Childrens Centres to link in the parents to relevant services.
Even with this change there will be some gaps as you describe for young parents –second time parents and those over 19 years. Working with young parents presents us with a range of challenges. We have surveyed many of our young parents over the years to find out how best to meet their needs. Some wanted groups specifically for them and others want existing groups to be more young parent friendly to reduce the feelings you experienced. In response to this we have tried to run groups for teenage and young parents. We did have some success with a group that started in Newstead 18 months ago but the parents grew older and were encouraged to move onto other services. We tried to set up young parents groups in Sutton and New Woods areas in the past year or so but either none or 1 parent turned up despite phone calls and encouragement from staff and other agencies.
As our partnership work with FNP develops, we will be able to set up groups for young parents and they will get that individual support to enable them to identify what they would like from getting together with other young parents, and so the opportunities for young parents to meet, socialise and learn will grow. If you have other suggestions please drop me an email or pass on the information through Jayne.
I wish you all the best in your continuing journey with Sure Start79835Health Partnerships - Nottinghamshire HealthcareRHA20797372012-11-21T10:15:18.61poXsmithxXsmithxThank you so much for the fantastic response. I'm so grateful that you have taken my comments on board.
It's brilliant with how many active volunteers that Sure Start have across the district. Sure Start help, support and advise that many families, it's incredible.
I'm really keen on working with younger parents. I hope one day that we could go into secondary schools to raise awareness of breastfeeding and more about Sure Start. I know for me it was never mentioned at school. I volunteer because it's my way of thanking Sure Start for the amazing support I received.

We are always keen to get both positive and negative feedback from patients, carers and staff in various ways as this helps us to continuously review and improve the services that we provide. Hopefully you received the new Carers’ Newsletter recently which detailed ways in which you could do this, including using the Patient Opinion website.
Unfortunately I am unable to comment on decisions made about your son’s care as I do not know who he is or what ward he is currently residing on. Clinical Teams sometimes have to make decisions which may limit patients’ access to things such as Section 17 leave. This decision is never taken lightly though and any changes to access will only be made after a thorough clinical risk assessment by the patient’s Clinical Team which meets weekly. If you would like to discuss your son’s care with his Responsible Clinician (Consultant Psychiatrist), then you can do so by ringing the unit and asking to speak to them. They may be limited in what they can tell you due to patient confidentiality issues, but they will be able to answer any questions you may have about the clinical decision making processes.
I would also urge you to attend the Carers’ Open Day on Saturday 15th December if you receive an invite from your son, as we are running three workshops for carers. These will hopefully provide you with some of the answers that you are looking for, as well as giving you the opportunity to raise questions about the treatment programmes here and your role as a carer.
Regarding transport costs, unfortunately we do not have a budget to refund these expenses to visitors. I am aware, however, that people receiving means-tested benefits such as Income Support can apply for financial assistance from the Department for Works and Pensions (DWP). Our Social Work team will be happy to assist you in this process if you wish. You can also get advice from the Carers Trust www.carers.org, Carers UK www.carersuk.org and also the NHS UK website www.nhs.uk/carersdirect.
I hope you find these agencies helpful.
Thank you again and kind regards

"263","Gerrard","The problems started when I was 14 and I kept getting into trouble. When I was 18 I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and I also suffered depression.
In 2006 I got involved with the Social Inclusion and Wellbeing Team who after talking to me found out about my passion for football. With the help of the team I completed the FA Level 1 and 2 coaching courses for sports leaders. I am now a volunteer at Stonebridge running the pitch activities and at Bilborough Pelicans. I am club captain at Notts County Pan Disability Team and in 2012 I was nominated as disability player of the year.
I feel now that the future is bright and my ambition is to be a coach on a disability football team. The Social Inclusion and Wellbeing Team helped me to take the first step on the rung of the ladder. I was quite volatile before but they made me feel at ease. They had confidence in me, which was a first for me!
I can say that football truly saved my life. I love football; watching, playing and coaching and I want to break down the barriers associated with mental illness. There is stigma but I deal with it by being open. My coaching course taught me to encourage the young kids I work with to ask questions. After all it is only by asking questions that we can learn.","RHA_710Adult mental healthRHANG3 6AARHA_710service","Today","the patient","79574","Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust What a fantastic story and so inspirational!

Can I say how much I enjoyed the day and a very big well done to Tony Mitchell from the Trusts Learning and development Team who organized the day.
We had an overview from Dr Julie Repper who is the Trust Recovery lead.
We then had a presentation from Simon Smith who is the Executive Director of Local services who talked about the Organisational commitment to promoting a Recovery Focused approach in ""all we do"".
This was followed by Jo Horsley and Bev Johnson who talked about promoting Recovery practice across teams ~& services in adult Mental Health Local services
As a member of the Trust involvement team and a service user myself we had the next slot and can I say how proud I was to see, Steven, Rachel, and Donna who are service users talk about how they are involved with the Trust and what Recovery means to them, this was just outstanding and this kind of interaction by people who use services helps makes the day what it was. Truly outstanding personal stories and shows what can be achieved by a recovery strategy that gives people hope opportunity and control.
This also helps the trust listen to the people it serves which helps all involved change services, Changes Lives, and helps change the culture. Could you kindly pass on my comments to Steven, Rachel and Donna please.
The next 2 presentations where just as amazing, Helen Brown talked to us about the Recovery Education College which is run by the Trust and how this has changed the lives of a great many people, Helen went on to say that the College now runs 100 different lessons and has up to 1000, people involved. Fantastic!
We then had what I can only describe as a ‘can hear a pin drop’ presentation by Emma, who is one of our Peer Support Workers tell her story and how she now has hope opportunity and control herself and how she now helps service users on a ward base setting. I have seen a great many presentations in my time but this has to be one of the best ever.. Emma was just so passionate about what she now does, again could you let her know what a great job she did today and helping others as she does, well wow!
Our last speaker was Nicky Bennett (Education Practice Consultant) who talked about the Training she delivers to Peer support workers all over the County, I can see why the training is so valued, and Nicky was fantastic.
In conclusion The Recovery Demonstration day was a great success, with people attending from all over the county; we even had people come to see what we do from the Channel Islands.

"267","StudentNurse91","Hi all,
I'm a student nurse, due to finish a three month placement with the self-harm team in Nottingham tomorrow and wanted to thank them for a really enjoyable experience but also wanted to share some of this experience with others.
The team receive referrals from the Queens Medical Centre paediatric wards when a young person has been admitted following an episode of self-harm/suicidal thoughts. During my time with the team, I have observed some excellent examples of practice. The team is made up of a nurse consultant and three clinical nurse specialists, all of which I must say are an inspiration to aspiring nurses. They are caring and kind individuals who truly do their best to offer support and advice to young people and their families in a time of crisis.
Despite the difficulties they face each day, the team remain positive and hold onto the hope that the young people they see will recover. The team members offer support to one another on a daily basis.
In addition to assessing young people, each member of the team has their own speciality; their ambition and drive to improve services for young people is evident by the commitment they put into continually enhancing their knowledge through training, research etc.
All of this is not recognition enough for the hard-work these nurses do. Thank-you for taking the time to share your knowledge, experience, values and attitudes with me, I hope more student nurses will be offered this as a placement in the future as I feel I've learnt so much in such a short time.","RHA_711Child and adolescent mental healthRHANG3 6AARHA_711service","Today","a staff member","79218","Julie Grant, Head of Communications, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustJulie Grant, Head of Communications, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustDear StudentNurse91

It was determined that I would need surgery to correct a big toe problem, caused through repeated trauma (damaged joint through football/work injuries etc). The condition, known as Hallux Rigidus, was to be treated, through surgery, using a fusion method, which would secure the arthritic joint, put the toe back in position and ease the pain when walking. 
I have had the operation and am now recovering, under the care of the Podiatric unit. From start to finish, Mr Hogg and his team have been fantastic. Surgery/operations are not something to enjoy, but through the professional approach of the clinic staff, I was able to feel like someone special.

Being in full time employment and not being able to attend midweek playgroups with my daughter I was very happy to attend this.
On my first visit to Dads Group I felt quiet nervous and I didn’t know what to expect, this was soon eased by the welcoming staff there they made me and my daughter feel very welcome. My daughter enjoys all the events put together by the Sure Start team at Dads group and most importantly the very messy play, she enjoys it so much she asks every weekend if we are going again.
At the beginning of this year I was asked whether I’d like to volunteer for dads group, and I was delighted to take up the opportunity. I get involved in setting up the group and helping out the staff with lunch and tidying up. While volunteering for Sure Start I have the opportunity to take part in training courses to improve my volunteering skills also volunteer meetings to discuss upcoming events and give out new ideas etc. Unfortunately being in full time employment I have missed these opportunities as these events are arranged during weekdays and during my hours of work.
Showing my interest in this line of work I have also being asked whether I would like to take up a childcare course with Sure Start. I was delighted to have this chance but unfortunately I later found this course required me to give 12 hours a week of work experience. These hours would be made up during week day events, this again isn’t possible for me while I'm in full time employment.","261-sure-startSure StartRHANG21 0HJRHA20Mansfieldservice","Last year","a volunteer/advocate","79189","Karon Foulkes, General Manager, Sure Start, Health Partnerships - Nottinghamshire HealthcareKaron Foulkes, General Manager, Sure Start, Health Partnerships - Nottinghamshire HealthcareThank you for your positive comments about your experiences in your local Sure Start Children's Centre.

"273","person with concerns","What I liked
Cosmetically the hospital is set in a lovely area with beautiful gardens etc.
Easy access,
Good times for visiing.
What could be improved
Communication from hospital staff to patients and family members was extremely poor indeed.
Whilst my father was in Lings Bar, he was not very happy and became quite low in mood.
It was very evident from myself and other family members visiting that there was a lack of duty of care . eg; my father had slippers put on the wrong feet, never had his socks put on , He reported that some staff were quite rude in the way he was spoken to.
He was never offered to have a bath there at all,despite being there for a number of weeks. Not even sure that they have shower facilities there.
Since leaving this hospital he has improved in mood 100%
It is quite evident in the evenings that there are not enough staff available on the wards .
I would not want my father to return to this hospital at all unless dramatic changes were made to the running of the hospital.","RHANN-inpatientInpatient nursing and rehabilitationRHANG2 6PRRHA20service","Unknown","","78720","Lings Bar HospitalLings Bar HospitalThank you for your feedback it is very important to us as it helps us to understand how we can make improvements to our service. I would really like to be able to discuss this with the ward team that it involves to ensure that we don’t have a repeat of any of the issues you mention.

What I can say is that all wards have baths and shower facilities and all patients are offered the use of these on a regular basis. If patients decline to use them then a strip wash in either the bathroom or at the bedside is undertaken with as much support and assistance the individual patients requires. We do place emphasis on encouraging as much independence as possible as part of the rehabilitation programme of care we provide but appreciate that this is not always appropriate for all patients in our service and an individualised care plan is developed ideally with the support of family members where possible and appropriate to do so.

I am very sorry that your fathers slippers were on the wrong feet at visiting – we do appreciate it if  families can inform us of any instances where care is not as family would expect at the time so we can review the situation and discover why this is the case and how we can put it right. Sadly patients can alter their own footwear whilst sitting and staff may not have seen that this was the case before the family have visited. (it is not clear if this was a one off instance or repeated.)

Staff are aware of their responsibilities and professional requirements and if they have been rude I would be really interested to know more about this so that I can fully investigate the issues raised with the staff involved. We are sorry if staff have been less than warm and caring in their approach to any patient in our care.

We do have a programme of exercise groups running in the wards and one ward does have a group each week to stimulate the mind by doing word association exercises and reminiscence group work with a volunteer this always helps to promote good mood with the patients who choose to attend. 

The staffing levels are set to a minimum safe level and we monitor this closely to ensure that the patients and staff are kept as safe as possible.

I am really very sorry that this experience has left you feeling so disappointed in the service we provide and I would be happy to discuss this in more detail with you if you wish to contact me as it is very difficult to provide a specific response as all the details are not available for me to check with the patient, family and staff in this case.

"274","nigelg","At the Rosewood Involvement Centre we have very close ties to our friends at Wathwood Hospital.
We got invited some time ago to attend the new Section 17 Restaurant, which is run by Service users and Staff at Wathwood.
7 of us set off to Wathwood and not rely knowing what to expect, we were keen to go and show our support. Of the 7 attending we had one Carer who is a Carer Recovery Champion, and 5 service users who volunteer at Rosewood and Involvement one of these is a service user Recovery Champion.
WOW! ! ! Is what come to mind,
What a fantastic Restaurant it is and I can speak from personal experience, before I worked for the Trust I worked 22 years in top 4 and 5 star hotels and restaurants’ in England and abroad,
The Restaurant was set with linin table cloths fresh flowers and Napkins, we were greeted by our waiter (a service user) who said hello introducing himself to all our party.
We then were given what can only be describe as a fantastic 3 course menu with choices to decide on. The food was just outstanding and professionally presented and served, in fact our waiter ‘Steve’ got to know all our names and used then throughout the meal, this is not an easy task for anyone so a big well done.
Phil one of the ward Managers and Involvement Lead at Wathwood also popped in to say hello which as we work with Phil a great deal at Involvement was just great. All the People from Rosewood know Phil and they were most impressed he popped in to say hello.
The highlight for us was Steve’ sat down with us at the end of the meal and it was clear to see that he had hope, opportunity and control of his own Recovery pathway and talked openly about how much he enjoyed the Restaurant and what this kind of work can do for him when he is ready to move forward. All the Staff and service users who were on hand were just fantastic all dressed up in formal black and whites, they looks the part and very very professional. At the end of the meal the service users who had been working in the kitchen came out and a very big well deserved round of applauds was forthcoming. We then got a guided tour of Wathwood.
I wish we could photo copy Wathwood and have it everywhere. The Hospital for me as a former service user is just one of the best examples of what can be achieved and the best example of what Recovery means outstanding.","RHARYWathwood HospitalRHAS63 7TQRHARYhospital","Today","a staff member","78409","Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust The restaurant sounds a wonderful example of what can be achieved with a strong recovery focus and a professional approach.

I know this review of the food and service will mean a great deal to the Wathwood staff team and the service users who will be given the opportunity to read this posting about their service.
It sounds very inviting!

The food’s good, they ask if you want more, they help if you need help. You don’t get a lot of tea or coffee if you can’t do it yourself. There’s not always dignity and respect, they say you can do it, sometimes they are a bit nasty if you keep spilling things. They pull you about a bit when dressing you.

I am sorry that you felt you did not get a lot of hot drinks - the ward does have a drinks round 6 times a day and you can always as the staff if you want another drink and they will fetch you one. We have ward housekeepers who are there to provide and assist patients with food and drink every day of the week.
I appreciate that at night the sound of staff talking can often seem a lot louder than perhgaps it is as the staff are still trying to undertake their work, they do try to keep their voices as low as possible but somethimes it is just not practical or safe to do that. I will ask the ward manager to remind the team to keep their voices as quiet as possible at night time as I undertsand how frustrating it may be to be kept awake by talking.
Washing of clothes is not something we can routinely offer in the hospital to patients as we do ask famiies to undertake this part of patients care and welbeing where possible. We do have small facilities available for those patients who do not have families to help but cannot offer it widely to all patients as the facility cannot manage that amount of laundry.

At the end of our visit I found out my wife is going home tomorrow. One of the nurses came specially to say good bye as she is off duty tomorrow'.
John Proctor Ward: 'I think they need more staff to do routine checks on patients to see if people are ok such as when they need to go to the bathroom as you have to wait for a nurse to come'.
'I think it's lovely here. Nice and airy. Nurses are very good. Nothing I could say that isn't good and I appreciate it. Food is quite good and you get a choice. Nurses work hard.
' Waiting times for nurses when you need to go to the bathroom could be better as I had an accident as I had to wait so long. '
' It's not bad here but I don't like the dark curtains as they make the ward look dark. Most of the nurses are alright. Food is quite good, better than QMC! '
' I had to wait two hours to get ready for bed. They could ask patients if they want to get ready for bed after tea. They don't come when you ring the buzzer.

The coments from John Procter ward are interesting and helpful for us to see, as help us to understand any concerns of our patients and families.
I can say that the ward is currently looking to recruit a new member of staff to the team which I hope will go towards supporting the staff and the patients.
I am concered that some patients are having to wait a long time to be able to access the bathroom facilities and or for a nurse to attend to them and will discuss with the ward manager why this may be and what we could do to improve this for the patients on the ward. however on a more postive note -
I am pleased though to let you know that we have been trialing on another of our wards, a system of staff undertaking regular ""rounds"" on the ward to see the patients and check if they have everything they need throughout the day and night, and we have had very positive feedback from patients and staff and so we are planning to extend this way of working to the other two wards in the very near future which I hope will improve the waiting times for buzzers to be answered and waits to get to the bathroom.
With regard to the curtains - these are a mid blue in colour and are disposable so that we can meet the infection prevention and control polices of the trust. these only are produced in this colour and it is something we have rasied with the company previously, so I am not able to consider a change to these at this time. We do have the curtains the same throughout the hospital as it provides a smart uniformed image and means we do not have mismatched colours and patterns when they need to be changed a different times.
All of your comments will be shared with ALL of the ward teams in the hospital - we aim to share all comments and enjoy the positive ones and ensure that where we can, we make improvements and learn from the ones that have some concerns.

"281","Happily613","I have had a mental health condition for the last 20 years. I have worked intermittently throughout. Unfortunately, I have never been able to sustain employment for long periods. This has largely been due to illness, negative and unsupportive attitudes on employers and colleagues. Previous back to work programmes have been linked to colleges; personal development programmes and voluntary work.
Presently I am making preparation to return to work. For the first time thorough a referral from my psychiatrist I have the support of a social inclusion worker (disability employment advisor) from the social liaison team- Nigel. For the past 6 months have received invaluable support in terms of practical and emotional support from Nigel. This person centred approach has enabled me to explore my career prospects in light of this economic climate.
Nigel provided me with excellent welfare advice in terms of disability return to work benefits and was able to guide me e. g. interview techniques and questions. The flexibility in his availability has also been very good e. g. recently he was a phone call away in answering queries re: my work contract.
Generally, I have found this service inclusive in locating our meeting in local venues and enabling me to set my own agenda. I also consider the prospects of Nigel's continued support during the first few months of my new job as invaluable in relieving anxieties and helping with the adjustment period from long period of illness to full time work.","RHA_710Adult mental healthRHANG3 6AARHA_710service","Last month","a service user","78318","Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Dear Happily613

I would like to share my story of a recent escorted community group leave.
This is the experience I encountered when visiting a football stadium for the first time. It so happened to be one of the most iconic, known worldwide with a following of supporters from every walk of life. Personally my club loyalty lay elsewhere, but visiting the home of Manchester United, Old Trafford Stadium was a pretty good place to start.
It was organised by the gym staff at Wathwood hospital and patients had to get permission from the MDT to attend, once all the paper work was in place. The 11th Oct was the day of the trip and everyone was in good spirits when we embarked on our epic journey at around 9am in the hospital mini bus. Travelling to Manchester we passed some stunning scenery snaking through the Pennines. As I looked on at the Moors in its rustic colour, some of idyllic hills were straight out of the movies simmering in the early morning mist. The buildings that we viewed engulfed by the deep crevasse by centuries of erosion, even when we looked up the hills seemed liked mini mountains. It truly was an experience that will forever been in my mind and that was just travelling to our destination.
When we arrived at Old Trafford, setting eyes on a stadium I have seen many a times on television in all its glory, I was surprised at sense of feeling conjured up by viewing such an sporting icon. We then made are way to the reception desk to buy tickets for Museum & Tour at a cost of £16. 00 and receiving a pass with lanyards. The tour guide took us to a plaque in memory of the eight M. U. players that died in the Munich air disaster, and a flame that has been burning since it was unveiled, and then unto the stands in the VIP section with padded seats looking at the pitch from a central position. I tried to imagine the atmosphere of 75, 000 screaming fans at a football match. He explained the seatting arrangements, club & press boxes and camera locations. We then visited players bar and changing room were replica football shirts of current first team players hung. Also in the room a white pitch board for football tactics that Alex Ferguson himself might have had pre match talks and halftime tactics with his M. U. squad. Then we were taken to the tunnel where the players emerge onto the pitch and the dugout, all the time our guide encouraged us to take photos of ourselves and surroundings, dropping subtle trivia like the grass for the pitch came from Rotherham, this made one of our patients smile. After the tour we then visited the museum looking at the replica trophies won over the years. Using the multimedia touch screen technology we watched certain match goals and plays.
Coming to the end of our day we spent some money in M. U. gift shop and the Red Café Bar. What by the way was not cheap, but one consolation we got our museum tour certificate signed and pictures taken with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who happened to be there with his family. I felt his actions were very charitable and kind to still have time for people in a public capacity even after leaving the club. Also those wonderful views of Pennine country side to look forward to enjoying on the way back.","RHARYWathwood HospitalRHAS63 7TQRHARYhospital","Last week","the patient","77778","Philip Dickinson, Ward Manager and Involvement Lead, Wathwood Hospital, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustPhilip Dickinson, Ward Manager and Involvement Lead, Wathwood Hospital, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustFirstly I would like to comment on the wonderfully written piece of literature, I found myself experiencing the day through their words.

"289","hector","I was struggling with very bad suicidal thoughts and thoughts of self harm I coped as long as I could without contacting anyone but it got to the point that if I did not speak to someone then I Knew that I was going to do one or the other or maybe both so as I have been told many times that if I am struggling them there is always someone at the other end of the phone so I plucked up the courage to ring the out of hours service.
the call was answered by a member of the county team, I told her that I was really struggling and she said that all the city team were out on visits but she would get them to call me when they got back in but it may be up to an hour so I was left to fight with my thoughts alone.
I waited and waited and waited for the phone to ring telling myself that they would call just to hold on to that thought I waited and waited but the call never came I felt that I could no longer fight on my own.
I feel that if they cannot do what they say they are going to do then they either should not say these things or even be in the job.
I am the one that has to live with the consequences of the things that I have done to get relieve from these thoughts that have over taken me and I feel that they do not care. It makes me feel like they won't even care if I live or die.
I have mostly had only good things to say about them before as they have always supported me quite well but at the moment am feeling let down and very alone.","RHA_10001Crisis resolutionRHANG3 6AARHA_10001service","Today","the patient","77733","Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust I'm really sorry to hear that you feel so let down and alone.

We would like to apologise that you did not get the response you required from our service. Calls to the crisis service are responded to by workers from a city or county team, whilst it is preferable for the appropriate team deal with a service users call, any worker should be able to respond to someone requiring support. We will ensure that the teams are aware that this has occurred and remind them of our protocols to provide support to callers. We hope this experience does not prevent you from using the service again in the future should you feel the need to.

Dear Hector
The out of hours service is jointly operated by City ACAT, County CRHT and City Recovery Home Treatment. While for continuity reasons it is preferable for a worker from the appropriate team to take a call, any worker should be able and willing to offer support. I am disappointed and concerned that this did not happen here. I will obviously remind the teams of the protocols and instruct them that they must accept calls of this type and offer appropriate support in the absence of a worker from the other team.

"290","Beckj4","A discussion forum took place at Millbrook Mental Health Unit in Sutton. Service users carers were able to share and discuss issues about mental health. These were some of the issues raised by service users:
Service users commented that GP's were not always understanding of what mental health patients need. It was suggested that more partnership working happen between GP's, service users and trust staff.
 By having a lived experiences, individuals felt that they would be able to help GP's have a better understanding of mental health issues if they just listened.
Some service users have experienced a lack of support from leaving acute care to go back to their community. They felt that this didn't help them to progress with their recovery and their lives.
It was suggested that the Trust think about the tone and content of the letters issued to service users of mental health services. Some felt that the letters could be constructed in more friendly manner and easier to understand. It was feared that staff perhaps didn't appreciate how these letters may effect the individual receiving the letters.
Some service users have been discharged from services and referred on to other areas without consideration as to whether that service would be beneficial to that person. Service users felt that teams were too keen to dischagre people but had to refer them on somewhere else.","RHA_710Adult mental healthRHANG3 6AARHA_710service","Yesterday","the patient","77590","Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust There are lots of points raised here that we need to address.

I speak as I find and I have no complaints. I wanted to get home when I arrived but I’ve been doing a lot of thinking since I arrived and I still want to get out but not until I'm feeling better. Recovery is important to me.

"299","LittleBigMan","Representatives from the Rosewood Involvement Centre and Duncan Macmillan Involvement Centre also a Peer support workers from Nottinghamshire Healthcare Trust attended a Human Library event at the Queens Medical Centre (QMC). 
I felt the philosophy of Nottinghamshire Healthcare Trust Involvement of changing lives, changing services and changing culture was apparent at the Human Library event at the QMC. 
The first thing I noticed about the students that their were very keen to listen to the Service users, Carers and also Peer support workers. We were split into groups and we were introduced to the young medical students. I also saw a wide range of diverse culture while I was at the QMC which I enjoyed. 
Although it was my first time talking to medical students about my mental health illness (schizophrenia). I started talking to the medical students and I realised they were very keen and asked very important and knowledgeable questions to which I was happy to answer, we had 20 minutes sessions with new medial students but we ran over time to time. This was proof to me that my Involvement with the Human Library was worth while because assisting and development of the next wave of the junior doctors will hopefully change services, lives and culture. 
I feel the Human Library is a great way to fight stigma and fight issues revolving around mental health difficulties and helps raise awareness in the development of future staff training. For me personally, getting the word out there is important. The Human Library is run by Volunteers and Staff who take on particular roles e. g. book monitor, Liberian and mentors
Very importantly we handed evaluation questionnaires to help the human library develop its strategy in going forward. 
I like to see more happening around human library; I want to see more training given to potential books with appropriate support
While I have enjoyed doing Human library at medical centres, colleges and with medical students I personally feel want to help raise awareness and fight stigma we should actively seek out opportunities to deliver the Human Library to the public. 
I would like to know how the Trust values the Services user, Carers Involvement in the Human Library.

Here is some information for you about the challenge. I hope you will register and join in!
Nine ambitious patient experience projects are about to start spreading their ideas to other areas of the NHS, after being selected as winners of the NHS Patient Feedback Challenge. The NHS Patient Feedback Challenge, created and managed by the NHS Institute and funded by the Department of Health, is a one year programme designed to find and spread great approaches which use feedback from patients to improve services.  
Since April, NHS organisations have been collaborating, sharing ideas, building projects, and bidding for a share of the £1m Patient Feedback Challenge fund, which was set aside to support the most promising approaches to measuring and improving patient experience..”  
The projects are as follows:
Partnerships inspiring changes to services, culture and lives - Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust 
Valuing Frontline Feedback - Ashford and St Peter’s Hospitals NHS Trust
Patient Partners - Bridgewater Community Healthcare NHS Trust 
Patient and Family Echo - East Cheshire NHS Trust
Both Sides Now - NHS North East London and the City
Improving Healthcare Together- Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust 
Kinda Magic - Peninsula Community Health CIC 
Real Time Patient Stories - South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust  
iCARE - Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust
 An essential element of the NHS Patient Feedback Challenge is the web channel where people can share ideas, make essential connections and identify spread partners.  It is an excellent way to stay in touch with the projects as they progress - visit the web channel for more detail on each of the projects and to become a project follower:  http://pfchallenge.clearvale.com/pg/dashboard/

"309","Clive1234","After coming out of hospital I felt very isolated and the time was just passing by. I even felt frightened to ask for help, but I did ask for help.
Going to SPAN encouraged me to take up courses in cookery and I achieved a number of NVQs. It was not easy and I had to retake a number of exams but I persevered. If I failed I would try again until I succeeded. To achieve my goals it took time.
The Social Inclusion and Wellbeing Team helped me to find a voluntary job in a cafe for 18 months but when it closed I decided to take a different direction in life. Once again I got support from the Social Inclusion and Wellbeing Team to take OCRs in administration. By taking the courses and by learning from books I went from not being able to use a computer to be confident at creating word docs, spreadsheets and powerpoint presentations.
I now work as a volunteer administration assistant. I gained a lot of confidence from working with a very supportive team. I have been like a yo-yo who keeps coming back up. I have learnt to not put myself down and to look after myself better
During all the struggles and difficulties I try to remember that it gets better, because if you fall off the horse you get back on again.

"310","concerned PR1","I read with dismay the posting titled “Health Related Benefits Reforms – Your Help is Needed”
I have recently been subjected to these “reforms”, having been on Incapacity Benefit I was sent for a work assessment medical which I “passed” or “failed” depending on your point of view. Subsequently I was put on Job Seekers Allowance (JSA) and soon found myself struggling financially. Maybe, I thought, this was the kick up the proverbial I needed to get back into employment. 
Soon after, I was successful in gaining employment as a Mental Health Support worker, working 16 hours a week with clients who have a mental health issue. I felt (and still feel) that I wasn’t ready to do full time hours. 
Unfortunately, three weeks after starting work I contracted a severe illness which kept me off work for four and a half weeks. The organisation I work for have been very good but I was only paid statutory sick pay for the time I was off. On top of this, I did not qualify for free prescriptions and have paid, so far, over £120 in prescription and over the counter medicines which has left me in a position of getting into debt (rent, council tax, water bills etc. )
So far my mental state (I too suffer from stress, anxiety and mild depression) is holding out, and I should be able to cope (I’m looking for full-time employment which I’m not sure I’m ready for). 
Over the last few months I have felt very fragile but I do realise that there are many, many people who are not able to cope with the way the Government, through its various agencies (including the DWP) are making it very difficult for people who are mentally (and physically) ill to have any hope in their roads to recovery. 
Come 2013, I feel it will only get worse with the introduction of Universal Credits and the changes in the way Housing and Council Benefits are funded. It's my opinion that there will be more and more people getting into debt and ultimately having to seek professional help (at a cost to the nation) as their mental wellbeing will suffer. 
I would like to offer my moral support to the person who wrote the posting.","RHA_710Adult mental healthRHANG3 6AARHA_710service","Unknown","other","76328","Tim Wood, Manager , NOTTINGHAM FOCUS ON WELLBEINGTim Wood, Manager , NOTTINGHAM FOCUS ON WELLBEINGDear ConcenedPR1

Firstly, thank you for telling your story.  I was sorry to read that you have had such a bad experience too.
I am convinced that this is only the beginning of very difficult times for people who are having their benefits reviewed, people who are often vulnerable and who might not be able to put over to Atos just how life is for them.

I am also concerned that decisions appear to be being made, about people's fitness for work on a short questionnaire and a medical which only appears to be concerned with the questions issued by the computer which directs the medical meeting.  My understanding is that this is often a cold process removed of human warmth and understanding.  At the same time I think it important that I acknowledge that the benefit review must be difficult job for those Atos employees that carry out the reviews.

In J's case he has been subjected to unnecessary stress and mental distress due albeit that the consultant working with him signed a letter confirming that J has currently limited capacity to work.  J is left very much out of pocket and has had his recovery set back unnecessarily. 
Thank you once again for your reply - hopefully more stories will come to light and we can evidence this as a means of facilitating change.

"312","Tim Wood","Health related benefits are going through enormous changes which appear to be having a negative effect on the people that as a Trust we represent: 
J’s story
J came to our service (The Social Inclusion and Wellbeing Service of Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust) with extreme anxiety and depression. J needed lots of support and coxing to move out of what he describes as his bubble. J was frightened of coming out of the bubble due to his distorted view of the world which has been formed due to the symptoms of anxiety and depression that he experiences. 
We (as a service) have supported J to move away from that bubble and get involved in the activities that we offered. J started woodwork at the SPAN centre where he learnt to use his hands in a therapeutic way. This was a start to J being able to manage his symptoms more effectively. J went on to join the IT classes which he really enjoyed and with support J was able to achieve a level 2, award in ICT. With a marginal change in J’s confidence we were able to encourage J to do voluntary work with us in which he supported the other students in the IT classes. J enjoyed giving back and became interested in teaching. 
We supported J to access teacher training with on-going support from us. J went on to achieve the level 5, diploma in Adult Teaching and more recently achieved Qualified Teacher status (Learning and Skills). None of this came easy for J; he required lots of support and guidance to work through the qualifications and the distressing symptoms he experiences, J continued to rely on his bubble as a coping/avoidance technique. 
We went on to support J to access supported permitted work within the Trust enabling him to use the skills he worked so hard for. The post is in a supportive environment which has enabled J to cope with part-time work at minimum wage rate. J really enjoys this role and manages the 15 hours reasonably well; although he never seems to be free of the on-going symptoms that he experiences. J’s mood remains fragile albeit that he is managing the work really well. 
J recently received notification that Incapacity Benefit was being withdrawn and he also received a questionnaire about his health and his capacity to work. J completed the questionnaire and attended the subsequent medical. A little while later J received a letter to say that his benefits would be stopping as he had been assessed as having capacity. The psychiatrist who is heading J’s care made it clear to the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) that J currently has limited capacity to work, hence our support for J on the supported permitted work, which we viewed as on-going therapy to help maintain J’s mental state and coping. Although ultimately the goal would be for J to do more independent work there is a little way to go yet as regards J’s recovery. 
Following this J had a letter from the council to say that his housing benefit was being stopped due to the DWP having stopped his benefit. As we had launch an appeal against the DWP’s decision J had to go and have his housing benefit reassessed and subsequently the housing benefit was reinstated. Having had his Incapacity Benefit withdrawn J no longer had the money to live on; the benefits agency then said they required a sick note this is despite them having the supported permitted work registered and they were aware of our on-going involvement in J’s care and recovery. 
J has now received a letter to say that he will be receiving ESA at a contribution rate whilst the appeal goes through. This means that J’s income is significantly reduced on top of which J’s housing benefit has been withdrawn again due to the ESA contributions not giving him the same access to housing benefit as his previous benefits. Housing benefit has also presented him with a bill for £400 due to the above changes. 
It is unforgiveable that J is going through such a stressful time due to the benefit review. J is trying to improve his future by accessing supported employment but has unfortunately fallen foul of the current benefits review. J will not be able to afford to pay his rent or Council Tax and the likelihood is that J will end up being evicted. 
Currently J is experiencing panic attacks and increased anxiety which appears to have been exacerbated as a direct result of the negative effects of the needless stress that J has been put under due to the benefits review. The psychiatrist working with J has increased his medication and remains concerned for his current welfare. J’s only hope is that his appeal is heard soon which is looking unlikely. I am going to write to the DWP again today and will feedback how this goes. 
I wrote to the Prime-Minister who directed my letter to the DWP some 6 weeks ago unfortunately I haven’t received a reply as yet. One of my colleagues is due to meet with her MP today. J met with his MP last week to highlight his plight. I intend to send the Prime-Minister a link to this story. 
I have also asked Mike Cooke our CEO to look at the issue of benefit reforms and the effect this is likely to have on the growing number of people we support as a Trust. As part of Mike’s answer to this he encouraged me to take the issues to the Mental Health and Employment – Community of Interest. I attended the meeting last night and put forward my concerns. This was quite productive, one of the actions that were decided upon was that the Community of Interest would gather evidence to look at what is actually happening to the service users that we support due to the health related benefits reform. This is where I hope you will help us gather this information:

The Mental Health and Employment Community of Interest shared your concern about the impact of the benefit reforms on service users with mental health problems
I would echo your request for people to share their stories so that we can gather evidence to help us try and highlight these problems
Obviously we think that employment is very important for people's long term recovery but this can be a long journey for some patients and its really sad that all the progress J made towards getting back to work has been put at risk in this way, but even more worrying to hear about the negative impact this is having on his health
We will be discussing this further at our community of interest meetings to see what we can do both to help service users and to highlight the issue with decision makers

"313","SOCIAL INCLUSION AND WELLBEING SERVICE","
I have been a service user of the  Individual Placement and Support (IPS) service for the past few months. I'd like to take this opportunity to voice what the IPS service and my Employment Advisor have meant to my recovery. A couple of years ago I was diagnosed with a severe psychotic depression. This condition ultimately led to my leaving a promising career with a local authority where I had been fortunate to do well and had a series of promotions. 
My recovery process began with the Crisis Team and was furthered by the CATT team. Under their guidance I did well and made great strides and yet the final stage of my recovery was still missing. Finding full time employment and being ready for that employment. The IPS service and Mel have been instrumental in this final stage. 
Mel started by working with me on my motivation, explaining the importance of completing a number of applications per week and reassuring me that how to deal with unsuccessful applications was part of the employment process. This helped me to overcome the 'fear of failure' feeling. Mel then worked with me to update and refine my CV, turning it into a document that employers would give serious consideration too. Mel's support didn't stop there, he read through cover letters and online applications that I put together and made invaluable suggestions. 
Mel's and my efforts combined to put together a number of applications that have recently been very successful. In the late June/early July period of 2012, I was fortunate to be offered three interviews, two for the NHS and one for Nottingham Trent University. I'm pleased to say that after further interview preparation with Mel and his very useful tips for the interview itself, I was fortunate to be offered an administrative assistant post with the NHS. This is an employer that I greatly want to work with. The additional two interview offers did wonders for my confidence and I feel ready to return to work full time. 
Mel's additional support in telling me how to manage my health while I'm in the new employment and strategies for recognising any early symptoms of a relapse while I'm at work, have greatly reassured me that I can complete this final stage of my recovery. 
I firmly believe in the recovery through work premise and I would like to testify that I wouldn't have been able to fully recover without the support of the IPS service and Mel . Thank you for your team's invaluable contribution to my recovery. 
Kind regards

The Chair IB has a very calming influence on the committee which is resulting in some excellent decision making. 
I continue to work in support of the committee and of course as an employee of Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust. I report to the committee once a month to feedback how things are going and take on any developmental work that is asked of me by the committee as well as the ongoing work that I do as part of the Social Inclusion and Wellbeing service.
The committee is constituted and made up of 8 service users, 1 carer and 1 public member; the administrative officers being I. B. (Chair) J. B. (Treasurer) and L. B. (Secretary). It gives me great pleasure to see this admin team and the committee working together for the betterment of the services that they support at Aspley Community and Training Centre.

"318","Tim Wood","I thought it important to let other's know of my positive experience of the NHS! 
Throughout my 30 years of working, I have had several episodes of serious mental health, triggered by life events, the latest catalyst being the break up of my marriage. As a result, I took little interest in looking after myself, eating food, unconsciously substituting food for drinks with endless cups of tea and glasses of water. 
Unfortunately, the consequence of this intake of excessive fluid was to lower the sodium levels within my body, I ended up in QMC on a life support machine. Medical staff nursed me back to health and I was discharged but the same pattern of non self care continued and within a month I was back on life support! 
Again QMC nurtured my physical health but the treatment for my acute depression and anxiety required a two month stay at Wells Road before being transferred to Macmillan Close.
I was referred to the Social Inclusion and Wellbeing Service as a way forward, prior to discharge.

I have been supported by my CPN and the home treatment team, and I am writing this to say a big thank you to the whole team at stone bridge. They have been amazing, nothing has been too much trouble and they have supported me well, even when I requested a visit at the weekend, they still came. 
I would also like to thank the staff at the involvement centre for also giving me encouragement and support. 
Without the extra support that I have received, I am sure that I would not be going on my holiday next week, as I feel sure that I would have either self harmed or tried to commit suicide, as I have really been struggling to stay safe.

Firstly thank you for your positive feedback. FOCUS is just over a year old now and we are trying our best to develop the courses and groups that we offer.
Funding for many organisations is very difficult in these rather austere times and we remain thankful that thus far Nottinghamshire Healthcare continue to support our work.  We do raise money in other ways too; this Sunday for example we will be selling at the Hucknall car boot, so we are expecting a 6am start.
Is there a particular area in which you think funding should be increased? We are always open to suggestions about how we can improve and develop our services.

Each day presents me with fresh challenging conditions to navigate and now I am developing the skills to set sail for brighter horizons. 
There will be storms and rough seas on my future journey and the outcomes may not be as I once predicted.  Now I recognise that these changes in direction are not failures just different destinations to where I originally set sail for....I am looking forward to this adventure  before me.

In recent months 'k' has greatly developed his self awareness, confidence, self esteem, positivity  and honesty.  Whilst 'k' has been approaching his personal development from multiple angles, the courses he has attended at The Nottingham Recovery College have been integral in his progression and have undoubtedly helped propel his self development beyond all recognition. 
K has found a new sense of belief in his own judgement and abilities and is now equipped with some practical coping strategies and a wealth of transferable skills. He has effectively applied the skills developed in the classes to everyday life situations. 
'k's progression is admirable and testament to his own hard work and efforts, but the tools, techniques and confidence developed within the supportive learning environment have made a great difference to his outlook..

Many thanks for your feedback regarding the volunteers on B50.  Without knowing your exact circumstances I cannot comment on ""Volunteers are still not taking patients out as much as they would like preferring to do activities.""  However I hope the following may be of assistance. The normal role for a ward visitor is to come to the ward and chat to the patients, play games and do activities.  If the patient they are with is an informal patient then they can if they wish leave the ward with them and go for a cup of coffee etc.  However if the patient needs an escort then unfortunately a volunteer cannot take them off the ward as they aren’t a paid member of staff.

I hope this is an acceptable response. We are always grateful for any feedback from people who see our volunteers. If you would like to discuss this further, please contact me at joanna.rapson@nottshc.nhs.uk

We still have a few minor details to overcome but they should be resolved soon

Thanks again to the patients for speaking to the Involvement Team and letting us know what concerns them about the ward.

If I might pick up on 2 of the issues raised. Firstly, the move to Highbury Hospital is scheduled for the second week in December, however, as you can imagine we are dependant on contractors and workmen completing work on time or supplies and goods being delivered to a set time frame, so there is much that can cause delays. The new ward will be for female patients only, male patients will be admitted to Daybrook Ward at St Francis Unit on the City Hospital Campus. I will keep you all posted on developments. 

Secondly if I could let you know that there is a small gym here (Autumn Leaves on A Floor South Block)at the QMC, specifically set up for our patients to use under the supervision of the physiotherapy team. If anyone would like to use this facility, could they speak to a member of staff or to the physio team? I gather that patients who use the gym must undergo an assessment to ensure their safety. Links have been made regarding the use of The Maples Gym at Highbury Hospital for when the ward moves.

Thank you again for your comments and concerns, please keep them coming! Your thoughts are invaluable to our service provision and help us to make it user friendly.

"328","hector","thanks to the staff and volunteer's at the involvement centre last week, I was admitted to redwood two at high bury hospital. I felt that my world was falling apart and that I could not carry on the way I was going. a volunteer spoke to my care coordinator as I felt that I was unable to do so as I had spoken to the crisis team during the night and they told me that they would get someone to ring me the next day. 
after speaking to that person and agreeing to go onto redwood I found out that no messages had been passed to this person so they were unaware of how badly I was struggling with suicidal thoughts. 
after only 4days on the ward I was asked by the staff to consider being transferred to the QMC or to go home and come back the next day for a review. as I know someone that is on the wards at QMC I thought it best to go home. 
On my return to redwood for review I was informed by my care coordinator that they did not know that I had gone home until 2pm that day and had to be at my review by 3.30pm. I feel that the communication is not at all good and needs to be improved greatly. 
I am at home now being supported by care coordinator and crisis team but feel that really I needed to have a longer stay in hospital but felt pressured into going home because I knew this patient on ward A43. I feel that this should have been taken into consideration as I don't feel that being on the same ward as a friend would have helped in my recovery.","RHA_710iInpatient mental health careRHANG3 6AARHA_710iservice","Today","the patient","73404","Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust  I am sorry you felt the stay in hospital was not long enough for you and that communication could have been better.

"329","Big Man","We are the Changing Services Group at Rosewood and we would like to share our views and comments of the AGM 2012. 
Steve (serice user volunteer and recovery champion) sadly wasn't present as he missed the bus! ! 
Sue (service user) attended the event for the first time and really enjoyed it. Sue stepped in to help a wheelchair user and helped him with his lunch and oversaw his needs for the day. Sue helped welcome visitors to the event and sign post them to the various infomration stands. 
Ingrid (carer volunteer and recovery champion) attended the event for the third year running. Ingrid was managing a stand at the event and was impressed this year at how visible the Involvement stand and the Human Library stand were in particular. It definitely attracted more people and interest, which is fantastic as we are trying to promote these services. Last year was quite poor as we were out of the way but this year we were at the front of the atrium. When Mike Cooke visited Rosewood in August for our ""Catch up with Cooke"" session he mentioned that it would be a good idea to have the same position at next years AGM. 
Soraya (service user volunteer Rosehip belly dancer) was unable to attend the event, however felt it would be a great idea to have the Rosehip Belly Dancers perform at the next AGM. 
The only negative thought from the group was the food on the whole was disappointing. In past events their has been a hot buffet but on this occasion it was sandwiches, crisps and a drink. It felt like a packed lunch rather than a proper lunch. On a positive note though the snacks that were bought round mid morning were very nice. 
We enjoyed the showcase given by board members, Dean Fathers, Mike Cooke and Ruth Hawkins. We felt that was a very valuable part of the day. The question and answer session was very good.","RHANottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustRHANG3 6AANottinghammental health trust","Last month","other","73279","Julie Grant, Head of Communications, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustJulie Grant, Head of Communications, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustThank you for feeeding back about how much you enjoyed the AGM and Annual Members' Meeting.

"330","1N1","Posted by the advocacy service on behalf of the patient in their own words; 
I am a service user at Arnold lodge on a personality disorder (PD) ward. There are 2 issues I want to bring to your attention. 
The first issue is telephone access, there are 7 wards on this unit; 3 mental illness wards, 2 female wards and 2 PD wards. When I attended the patients forum some months ago it was mentioned that all the other wards could use the telephone freely with no time restrictions during the day so long as it didn't get in the way of treatment. The PD wards have 15minutes maximum per day (incoming and outgoing calls combined) and only after 6pm until 9pm. It has also been raised in the Patient Satisfaction Survey and nothing has been done about it. The Mental Health Act Code of Practice says (16. 3) 'Hospitals should make every effort to support the patient in making and maintaining contact with family and friends' (16. 4) 'The principle that should underpin hospital or ward policies on all telephone use is that detained patients are not, of course, free to leave the premises and that individual freedom to communicate with family and friends should therefore be maintained as far as possible. Any restrictions imposed should be the minimum necessary, so as to ensure this principle is adhered to. ' (19. 4) 'Patients should have readily accessible and appropriate daytime telephone facilities'
I believe the restrictions placed on patients with BPD is unfair and discriminates against patients with a personality disorder. 
The second thing is the patients on the PD wards are not allowed food brought in by visitors either to eat during the visit or to bring back to the ward. As far as I am aware, all other wards do not have this restriction. I believe again that this is unfair and nothing has been done about it when we have raised it as a complaint.","RHAARArnold Lodge Regional Secure UnitRHALE5 0LERHAARservice location","Today","the patient","72985","Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Dear 1N1

Thank you for taking the time to post your story on the Patient Opinion website.  It is always good to hear what patients have to say, whether it be complimentary or critical, as that is how we continue to develop as a service.  Please accept my apologies for the delay in my response on this occasion.

I am aware that both of the issues that you have raised, i.e. telephone access and visitors bringing in food, have been of concern to the male PD patients for some time and are regularly mentioned at the Patients’ Forum.  I also know that you have had responses from the PD Clinical Team regarding both issues but you are not satisfied with their reply.  As you are aware, Arnold Lodge provides a range of treatment services to patients with different clinical needs, the therapeutic needs of whom are often different and the ward rules and procedures therefore vary accordingly.  That said, I’m aware that you believe that the restrictions imposed within the PD service are both inequitable and unjustifiable in comparison to the other services within Arnold Lodge.   

I would like to discuss the issues you have raised with the Arnold Lodge Management Team so that we can review what we provide as a whole unit rather than just focussing on the male PD service, as you have raised some very fair questions in your posting regarding equity of service provision .  Our next Management Team meeting is on Monday 10th September and I have asked for your posting to be one of the agenda items, after which I will respond again and report to you any decisions that have been made.

Kind regards

Thank you for your posting and please accept our apologies for the delay in responding.  As you raised issues concerning equity of service, we felt it was important that we discussed these issues as a Management Team rather than just within the PD carestream, especially as there were potential implications for patients across the unit.  As you are aware, the Management Team met on Monday 10th September and discussed your posting in the presence of Maxine Whale, one of the patients’ advocates.  We discussed both of the issues in depth and agreed the following.   

Firstly, regarding telephone access, it became apparent that there is some discrepancy regarding telephone access between Ridgeway and Cannock Wards.  We felt that this was unjustifiable within the same carestream and have agreed that the timings should be consistent across both wards.  We also felt that this should include an extension to the time allowed to access the telephone in the evening.   We have recommended that the time allowed is increased from 3 hours to 3.5 hours so that all patients can have their allotted 15 minute telephone call if required. We have asked the Ward Managers to agree these times between themselves and to feedback to patients when a decision has been made.  We felt that 15 minutes was sufficient and reasonable and will not be making a recommendation to increase this allowance. 

We discussed access to the telephone at lunchtime and agree with the decision made by the PD Service clinical team that social phone calls should not detract from treatment programmes in any way.  However, patients can request an exception to this for special circumstances which must be agreed by the Clinical Team.  In urgent situations, this decision can be made by the Nurse in Charge.  

 Secondly, regarding Cannock and Ridgeway patient visitors being unable to bring food in to eat on visits.  It was considered that this is a reasonable precaution within a secure unit in order to prevent contraband being brought into the unit, although we considered it unfair to only apply the restriction to one group of patient visitors for reasons of security.  We will therefore review the practice of any visitors bringing in food and drink items for any patients within the unit.  The only exception to this restriction will be food brought in by visitors for special occasions such as birthdays or religious festivals.  This will need to be agreed with the Clinical Team in advance and unconsumed items will not be able to be taken back to the ward for later consumption.  It was considered that all patients could pre-plan for their visit and buy confectionery, snacks and drinks whilst on leave or from the patients’ shop to share with their visitors.  Tea, coffee, squash and water are already provided for visitors.

Thank you for bringing these issues to our attention.
Kind regards

76197Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS trustRHA729852012-09-25T09:04:49.407po1N11N1Posted by the advocacy service on behalf of the patient in their own words;
Thank you for your reply dated 25/9/12.
I am very unhappy with your response as you appear to have disregarded the Mental Health Act code of practice 16. 3, 'Hospitals should make every effort to support the patient in making and maintaining contact with family and friends’
16. 4. '’The principle that should underpin hospital or ward policies on all telephone use is that detained patients are not, of course, free to leave the premises and that individual freedom to communicate with family and friends should therefore be maintained as far as possible. Any restrictions imposed should be the minimum necessary, so as to ensure this principle is adhered to. ’
19. 4 ‘Patients should have readily accessible and appropriate daytime telephone facilities’
In addition I would like to point out the following;
1. in your reply to PD wards patients telephone access the only difference between Cannock and Ridgeway is the timing of the access; Cannock is 6. 30pm-9. 30pm and Ridgeway is 6pm-9pm. Giving or allowing an extra extension of 30mins isn’t in line with the rest of the hospital and wards. For your information the extra 30 mins has not been implemented.
2. Regardless of the increase to ensure ‘consistency’ across both wards patients will not have their allotted 15 mins access increased in any way.
3. All wards at Arnold Lodge have treatment and structure to their day on a week to week basis, to say for PD services to have access during the daytime would detract from our treatment programmes is wholly unjustified, unfair and cannot be right.
4. We are care planned throughout our treatment and treatment programmes and if use of the phone was to become therapy interfering we would be stopped from using it as would happen with individual patients on any other ward.
5. Why should we be treated differently to all other wards? Why can we not be given the opportunity to show we can make this work?
6. Surely increased daytime access to the telephone for patients on the PD wards can be managed as it is throughout the unit on all other wards.
FOOD
1. Regarding food being brought in for patients via visitors, this is still continuing and not just for consumption during visits. Food items are still going up to the wards except PD wards. This is wholly unfair to the male PD wards.
2. The policy was until recently factory sealed items of food only and this has only on very rare occasions caused a problem of security regarding contraband.
3. The same could apply to other items brought in by visitors for patients I. e. Clothes, shoes, DVDs, CDs toiletries etc? Are you going to ban them as well?
4. All items should be thoroughly checked and searched before being given to patients no matter what ward they are on or what care stream they come under?77766729852012-10-15T11:18:58.843poInvolvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust I am sorry that you are unhappy with my last response. I disagree with your statement that we have disregarded the Mental Health Act code of practice in relation to ‘supporting the patient in making and maintaining contact with family and friends’. As you are aware, we facilitate social visits from family and friends as well as telephone contact and we also host regular Carer’s Open Days, the next one being on Saturday 15th December. We also believe that the restrictions imposed on telephone access on all wards are the minimum necessary required for those patient groups and the restrictions are therefore justifiable on clinical grounds.
Regarding the additional time for telephone access on Ridgeway and Cannock wards, there has been a delay in implementing this as we needed to ensure that all staff were aware of this change beforehand, as alterations had to be made to the Ward’s Departmental Instructions. There will not be an increase to the 15 minutes allotted telephone access time for individual patients, but the additional 30 minutes added to the time available will ensure that all patients can utilise their 15 minutes during that period of time, thereby giving a bit more flexibility. The telephone access times in the evenings are now as follows: Ridgeway 5.30pm – 9pm and Cannock 6pm – 9.30pm. As stated in my previous posting, patients can request an exception to be made to allow telephone access at other times for special circumstances which must be agreed by the Clinical Team. In urgent situations, this decision can be made by the Nurse in Charge.
Regarding food being brought in for patients by visitors, this has also taken some time to implement as all patients, visitors and staff had to be informed of this change before its implementation. Staff and patients are now aware and all visitors have been sent a newsletter to inform them of this change and a poster displayed in reception. The unit ban on visitors bringing in food and drink for patients across the service is being implemented from Saturday 1st December. The reason for this change is predominantly security related but also for reasons of healthy living. As stated previously, exceptions may be made regarding food and drink brought in by visitors for special occasions such as birthdays and religious festivals and this will need to be agreed by the Clinical Team in advance of the visit. We are not currently thinking of stopping non-food items being brought in by visitors as you suggest, I.e. clothes, shoes, DVD’s CD’s, toiletries, etc, but we will keep this under constant review.
Thank you again for bringing these issues to our attention. Given that I have responded to all of your points in detail, I now consider this matter closed.

I am replying to your posting on Patient Opinion as the Governor Ambassador for Wathwood.

Firstly thank you for your comments, I am glad to hear that your experience of Wathwood and the staff team is a positive one as I too share this opinion.

I was at Wathwood yesterday 9th August 2012 and visited the assessment ward where I had the opportunity to talk to patients as well as look at some of the security processes that staff and patients have to go through.  

I was particularly impressed by Steve and Graham who took me through some of the security checks that they have to do. Whilst carrying out room checks Steve and Graham interacted well with the patients that were in their rooms.  It was good to see that (although these checks might be observed as being intrusive) Graham and Steve made the process as friendly as it could possibly be.

I also had the opportunity of talking to two patients whilst I was on the ward (who were going through the assessment process) so far they felt that the facilities and staff were good; my plan is to catch up with these two individuals in a couple of months time to see how things are going. 

I visit Wathwood every month and would welcome meeting with you to find out about your journey through Wathwood.  

With all good wishes

As usual I was asked the same questions many times. There was a question about alcohol which I answered honestly. I am 68 years old and was told that with my smoking as well I would be lucky to last another two years!
I was put on Thiamine and was recommended going to go to a drink and drug centre, I was also on Warfarin and a reading of the level of the drug was astronomically high. I think it was a freak reading.
However, I was taken off Warfarin and now have to inject myself with Enoxoparin every day. This was a blessing because the drug is not affected by alcohol. One can drink with Warfarin but have take the same amount every day.
Released from the burden of the same amount of alcohol every day, I found it relatively easy to drastically to reduce my intake to a reasonable level. In this respect Oxford Corner, an alchohol and drug rehabilitation centre was very helpful.

"342","GrumpyPlusplus","After three months of agonising foot pain I finally got referred to a bio-mechanical podiatrist. He made me some heel lifts which helped me greatly. Unfortunately they are too short to wear unless under the insole of a shoe.
Therefore I am stuck with one pair of comfy shoes. I have to wear these lifts all the time. I've asked on several occasions over the past eight weeks for more pairs so that I can change shoes etc. After one call the podiatrist forgot. After the second call I was sent the wrong sort of lifts. After the third call I returned them at a time when the podiatrist was in clinic.
I have no way of knowing if he was actually given them to alter. Ten days later I still don't have any replacements.

 The staff nurse jade was really good she did lots of relaxation courses for example yoga and she helped me through my problems. The good points about a42 it was always clean the food was good 3 meals a day and a large varity. The bad points are that every time I had asked to be escorted it took 4-6 hours to get outside in the fresh air, also when ever I went on weekend leave wen I was due back there would never be hospital bed or it would have changed.
 They wanted to take me to another hospital due to there being no hospital beds when I am based in nottingham thats where my whole family is, also one night after weekend leave they wanted to put me on the intensive care unit.
 I highly recomened the nurse Sam on a42 he is great at his job really caring and helps you with any problem. My DR I can't fault him at all he helped me to understand my illness.

By 10: 30 the whole place was buzzing as the attendees were treated to an array of different stalls promoting the good work that the Trust is involved in. It was a great opportunity for patients/service users, carers, members of the general public and staff to get together and celebrate what as a Trust we are getting right. 
The event was (as ever) brilliantly organised by Julie Grant and her hard working team, they were able to put on an event that was more than successful and which went like clock-work. Well done Julie and her team. 
At 1pm we were treated to hearing many excellent speakers who represented the board, the members council and the involvement team. 
This was an excellent day, it was extremely positive and forward thinking.

"347","fubar","I suffer from severe chronic depression and anxiety. Life is a daily struggle but I have been fortunate to access creative sessions run by the social inclusion and wellbeing service of Nottinghamshire healthcare trust for a number of years. These sessions are my lifeline. As well as giving me a brief respite from my symptoms, they provide valuable social contact, peer support, a regular and achievable goal and the only positive aspect in my life. 
On Friday, I was informed I was to be discharged from the service. No reason was given. I assume it was either a cost cutting exercise or to massage the ""success"" rate of the service. I was offered the token panacea of ""support"" and ""signposting"" to other activities but, which from experience, I know do not cater as well for those of us with mental health problems. I was devastated at the news. I had been presented with a ‘fait a complis’ without anyone discussing the state of my health beforehand. In fact, I was already very low, struggling to leave the house, and seeing my psychiatrist every four weeks, facts I pointed out to the poor soul who had been tasked with passing on the judgement from above. 
On Monday, I received a phone call saying not to worry, the social inclusion and wellbeing service hadn't realised I was still seeing my psychiatrist so I wouldn’t be discharged after all. So that's alright then. 
No it isn't.
You see, I was absolutely devastated to have my lifeline withdrawn. 
I spent that weekend planning how I was going to end my life. The one thing I had that made life worth living had been taken away. Not only that, I felt that my reaction to that loss was stupid and pathetic. I used to be a normal, competent person, now I'm an idiot who can't find another art group to go to. 
The week before, my care coordinator was supposed to meet me at the psychiatrist appointment. He never showed up and hasn't been in touch since. The siwb service couldn't be bothered to get in touch to see what state I was in, before making decisions about my future. 
In the space of a week the (in)actions of so-called professionals have made me feel worthless and knocked me down in to the pit of despair.","RHA_710Adult mental healthRHANG3 6AARHA_710service","Last week","a service user","72466","Tim Wood, Manager , NOTTINGHAM FOCUS ON WELLBEINGTim Wood, Manager , NOTTINGHAM FOCUS ON WELLBEINGDear Fubar

"349","Tim Wood","It was my great privilege along with Helen Forrester (ward manager) to be invited to speak at Patient Opinion’s NHS Midlands and East Stakeholder workshop. There were also a number of excellent speakers from other organisations who were at varying stages in their adopting Patient Opinion. 
I was able to describe how I use Patient Opinion (PO) in three ways as a staff member of Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, as a Trust governor as well as telling my story about my experience of mental ill health.
PO as a staff member: I told the delegates how I ask the people that use the service I manage on behalf of the Trust (FOCUS) to complete the back part of the PO leaflet telling their story/experience of using the FOCUS service – I do not ask for any other details other than this so as to enable the feedback to be anonymous. These stories are handed in and a volunteer enters them onto PO as they are written (the originals are kept for authenticity purposes). I respond to these stories as soon as I receive them from the PO moderators. 
PO as a governor: I explained how I am using PO to feedback about the service I support as a governor and the benefits to the service and my development as a governor. 
PO telling my story: I also told delegates how I have used PO to tell my story with view to helping the anti-stigma campaign. 
It was clear that Nottinghamshire Healthcare has a lot to celebrate due to how it has embraced PO within the organisation and this was certainly acknowledged by PO. PO has been championed on behalf of the Trust by Jane Danforth (Trust involvement officer) who is working tirelessly in taking a lead with this important initiative.
We are not quite there yet; PO needs to be embraced by more staff members and for them to see it as a way of informing the developmental needs of their service/practice in an open and honest format. Helen Forrester (ward manager Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust) described how she feels the ward she manages is benefitting from using PO and how this has enabled her to deal with patient’s concerns about the ward environment. Helen’s ward also openly feeds-back issues raised within their ward meetings and these also appear as entries on PO, which Helen is able to respond to and feedback what has happened as a result of any issues that arose from these meetings. 
I felt the day was of enormous benefit as a sharing event which is really what PO is about: sharing good practice by responding and acting upon feedback from the people that access NHS services. 
On reflection two valuable things came out of the day for me; firstly the day has made me realise that people using the FOCUS service have the opportunity of feeding back by using the paper method described above but without a computer they wouldn’t be able to see the responses. I heard how other providers printed off the stories and responses so that they can be displayed in ward areas etc. As a result I am going to change my practice and print the stories off along with the responses and pin them up so that the originators can see them. Secondly on hearing about how Helen records issues that come from meetings I am going to approach the committee of service users that help run FOCUS to whether they would allow issues raised in their meetings to be published on PO.
Finally I am working with Jane Danforth in supporting the rest of the team I work with (Social Inclusion and Well Being service) to look at how team members might use PO to aid their practice/service development through engaging the people that use their services in a feedback culture. I would ask all Trust staff to look at how they could embrace using PO, why not contact Jane who I am sure will be more than happy to point you in the right direction.","patientopinionPatient Opinionweb siteRHANottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustRHANG3 6AANottinghammental health trust","Today","a staff member","71089","Julie Grant, Head of Communications, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustJulie Grant, Head of Communications, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustTim

"390","Nature849","Four years ago I had a very serious mental health crisis. Looking back all the warning signs had been building for a very long time. By the time my crisis struck I had ended up in a very bad place. I immediately sought help and was put on a waiting list that I was informed would take 18 months to two years to get referral to a psychiatrist. I went into this informing the doctor that I had Aspergers Syndrome at all times.

When finally my 2 years were up and I was offered psychiatric care I had 3 assessment sessions before being told I was TOO ASPERGERS for psychotherapy.

4 years after requesting help the only actual therapy I have received has been antidepressants and ritalin. I still haven't received significant talking therapies. I find this unacceptable.","RHA_710Adult mental healthRHANG3 6AARHA_710service","More than a year ago","a service user","68582","Ann Wright, Service Manager, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustAnn Wright, Service Manager, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustThank you for your feedback. We are sorry that you had to wait for an unacceptable time for your assessment and you haven’t received the treatment you expected.
Although helpful to many, psychotherapy can sometimes be very difficult for some people to cope with. This is assessed for by the psychotherapist as part of the assessment and may require more than one appointment for the assessment.
The outcome of assessments should be discussed with people at the time, with clear explanations and reasons for any decision made. We continue to work hard on reducing waiting times in the psychotherapy services and these have improved, with appointments being offered on average within 5 weeks. This obviously doesn't help your situation but I hope it reassures you about the services improving waiting times.

"394","Janzq3","The patients on ward B50  regularly meet with staff and the involvement team to talk about life on the ward. The June meeting was all about care and any issues that people wanted to raise.

One patient was full of praise for the staff and commented,  'Staff will listen, they are very supportive. I like the fact that staff don't wear uniforms as it breaks down barriers.' They have the personal touch and I don't feel restricted as staff are very flexible.'Another patient commented on feeling safe whilst on the ward'.

An issue was raised about a cordless mobile phone that was requested for to help with privacy for patients when making calls. Unfortunately this request had been turned down. Patients felt it wasn't much to ak for as it was quite cheap to purchase and would mean that patients could have some privacy when talking with their families. They asked again if this could be reviewed and reconsidered?

2 other issues were raised. One was about the smoking policy. It was explained to the patient that we are a no smoking trust. The patient accepted it was sensible but he found it hard to smoke less.
Big name badges were also mentioned again as some patients found it hard to see the exisiting name badge where the writing was small.
The ward manager also let people know that the  pahramacist Sarah Brennan was available to see patients to talk about  their medication.

Another patient concluded the meeting by saying that he was receving brilliant care and that individuals count on Ward B50.","RHANottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustRHANG3 6AANottinghammental health trustrha_715Older people's mental healthRHANG3 6AARHA_715service","Last week","a staff member","68569","Helen Smith, Community service manager/AHP lead, Nottinghamshire Healthcare  NHS TrustHelen Smith, Community service manager/AHP lead, Nottinghamshire Healthcare  NHS TrustThank you for posting the information from the patient meeting.

"395","Tim Wood","The aptly named restaurant Section 17 sits within Wathwood Hospital and is a venture built on the success of The Clink; a restaurant formed within HMP High Down.
I didn’t really know what to expect but what I received was outstanding.  On entering the restaurant I was met by smiling faces; patients and staff working together.  The waiters were all smartly dressed with crisp white shirts and black bow ties.  The restaurant itself was beautifully laid out with smart table decorations and flowers.  I sat on a table for four. 
There was the choice of 3 or 4 starters, main courses and sweets.  I chose the cream of vegetable soup the roast pork and the lemon posset.  The food was promptly brought to the table and was presented as in any first class establishment; the flavours were superb.  I was particularly impressed that many of the dishes were gluten free; I was therefore able to eat the shortbread that was presented with the lemon posset and they were delightful.
All in all what a wonderful luncheon cooked and served by a brilliant team of chefs and waiters.  I am sure this venture will grow and provide excellent opportunities for the patients to develop their catering skills and qualifications.
Many thanks to all those involved; your hard work certainly paid off with all good wishes for the future of this venture.

As recovery champions our aim as a group is to give real time feedback to the trust to support the recovery strategy. Patient Opinion is very important to us.
We will be evaluating peer support workers by assisting patients with the INSPIRE questionnaire on acute wards. As service users/ carers we hope to inspire others by sharing our personal experiences.
On the 11 May 2012 we held our monthly Involvement Recovery Links Group (IRLG). Our guests were from Wathwood (a medium secure hospital), Arnold lodge (also a medium secure hospital), Tony Mitchell - Learning and Development and Michelle Malone from Adult Mental Health.
The subjects we covered were the trust's olympic walk, Soraya (a service user) pledged to walk 12 miles, and various service users/carers will complete a mile.
We had 3 service users telling their personal stories and Steve (a service user/ recovery champion) did a fantastic job as new chair of this meeting. Phil from Wathwood spoke about the garden party that will be taking place on saturday 16th June to raise money for charities. Other speakers updated news regarding involvement which we all found most interesting here are some of the comments from people that attended the meeting:
----------
Rosewood recovery links group 
The meeting was very positively introduced, with every single participant being made to feel super welcome.
The atmosphere was fantastic, with everybody being celebrated for their attendance and participation.
The meeting included a combination of information being provided and personal experiences being shared and discussed.
This event truly promotes recovery values and principles and is living proof of how or what recovery can look like in real life.
It was impressive that there was a very good mixture of staff/ managers/ carers/ service users and volunteers and everyone contributed - without any hierarchy or obvious 'rank'.
A really really fantastic experience.
Tony Mitchell - Learning and Development.

The monthly recovery meeting at Rosewood Involvement Centre is a super forum for service users, carers, and staff to get together and share information, successes and stories. I always receive a very warm welcome and I am always inspired by the commitment of all the rosewood volunteers and i always learn something.
Thank you so much and keep up the good work.

I am not familiar with the registration system at The Maltings, so I can not make a comparison. First time visitors to The Health Shop are usually taken through an assessment. This helps staff to know about the client so they can provide the relevant harm reduction information, and any risky situations can be addressed.

I understand from the staff, that you did not have time for an assessment on this occasion so the staff acted responsibly in providing you with an ‘emergency pack’ to see you through until the next mutually convenient appointment. Clients are advised to check what they have been given before they leave the building so that any problems can be dealt with.

The Health Shop does shut at 4.30pm on a Friday however there are other places to go. As you have access to the internet, I recommend you go to www.referrersguide.com for details on services and pharmacies providing a service to drug users in Nottingham, including ‘out of hours’ provision.

I hope that you return for your assessment at The Health Shop. The staff provide a very good service to many people and I’m sure you will find that your needs are met in a supportive way.

If you have any questions, or further feedback, please feel free to contact me via The Health Shop (0115 947 5414).

"407","elderflower","17 years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after experiencing what I believed and still do believe was a religious conversion.
Previous to my first admission to a psychiatric unit I phoned gay switchboard. I believe that I was given ECT illegally without my permission, from an old portable machine, but how can I prove it since it will not be in the notes?
Now, 17 years on, I am winning the battle of discovering who I really am. I do however find it very strange to know that the head of our spiritual and pastoral care department at the NHS trust in our area, although he professes to be a Christian, says that he does not believe in the resurrection of Christ. I believe that this sort of attitude robs Christian service users of all hope.","RHA_710Adult mental healthRHANG3 6AARHA_710service","Unknown","the patient","67044","Paul Quilter, Head of Spiritual & Pastoral Care, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustPaul Quilter, Head of Spiritual & Pastoral Care, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustDear Elderflower,
   Thank you for taking the time to share something of your experiences. The journey of self discovery is indeed hugely challenging and I am pleased that you have made good progress. I would want to offer you much encouragement and, if appropriate, continuing support.
   The role of the Spiritual and Pastoral Care Service is to support people of all faiths and of no faith. We do not think it would be helpful to promote any one faith or try and interpret what people from any one tradition should believe. We are anxious to support everyone in their spiritual journey and to help them work out for themselves what is right. We believe it is important to respect each person and encourage them in any way we can and I hope you will call upon the Trust's Spiritual and Pastoral Care Service for help and support at any time in the future. You are assured of a warm welcome.
   I am sure you will appreciate that Christians hold a wide range of views and beliefs and also interpret faith in different ways (This is reflected in the many different Christian denominations). I actually attend a Quaker Meeting and Quakers hold varying views and beliefs about the biblical accounts of Jesus' resurection .  Perhaps I interpret what it means to be a Christian and how I interpret the biblical accounts of Jesus's resurection differently from you but to suggest that I do not believe in the resurection does not reflect my perspective and I hope you feel reassured. I certainly affirm you in your beliefs and will endevour to support you in your own quest for the truth.
   Might I encourage you to take another look at the Trust's Spiritual and Pastoral Care Service. We are doing some really exciting work and are trying to help many people on their personal journey and search for meaning and hope.
With warm regards.
Paul Quilter

"409","Tim Wood","It was an absolute privilege to have been invited and witness the opening of The Lodges at Wathwood Hospital.
It is thanks to a hard working staff, exceptionally talented patients and the passion of the service management that 'The Lodges' has been developed in such a wonderful way.
The ceremony itself commenced with inspiring words from Atol one of Wathwood's patients.  Atol was so proud of all he has accomplished whilst he has been a patient at Wathwood.  Atol was clearly very happy with the care he has received as a patient and now promotes the positivity that Wathwood instils in its patients.  Atol is hoping to be considered for one of the beds in the unit (which opens to patients in the next couple of weeks) which will hopefully be part of his 'step down' and move towards him being discharged from hospital.
This was a remarkable afternoon and a time to truly celebrate; for me this far outweighs The Jubilee and The Olympics.  We get to witness so very little positivity in life these days, the opening of The Lodges at Wathwood is truly monumental.
In my many years of working in the NHS's mental health services I have witnessed many divides between patients and staff which have demonstrated professional working relationships which have been devoid of human warmth; this can't be said of what I have witnessed so far at Wathwood. I am proud to say that I have thus far only witnessed warmth and empathy from the staff at Wathwood, which I am sure is why the environment is so conducive to excellent patient care.
I would suggest that the most important things about patient care are human warmth, taking the time to care, and the channelling of hope. This works from the top down, we are fortunate that we have a Chief Exec and Chair that take the time to talk and more importantly listen to patients who are under the care of Nottinghamshire Healthcare.
Wishing all the very best to the patients and staff at Wathwood and good luck with moving into The Lodges.","RHARYWathwood HospitalRHAS63 7TQRHARYhospital","Today","a staff member","66860","Philip Dickinson, Ward Manager and Involvement Lead, Wathwood Hospital, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustPhilip Dickinson, Ward Manager and Involvement Lead, Wathwood Hospital, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustFirstly we would like to thank Tim Wood for the kind, postive comments and reflections of Wathwood.

"410","Amy at Patient Opinion","Today, Patient Opinion held an event for Notts HC (including health partnerships division) staff to inspire them to see that people's stories about their healthcare experiences hold the key to delivering better care to everyone.

We wanted the event to be more than just a morning of presentations - we wanted to leave a legacy. The room was filled with dedicated and hard working staff who genuinely care about people's stories - so we wanted to motivate them to capture more and to ensure that every story has an impact, positive or negative. 

The staff identified a priority challenge for themselves and the Trust, which was ""to ensure that each team shares the feedback it receives with every member of it's team"". 

Everyone committed to doing atleast one thing over the next few weeks to make sure they achieved the challenge together. Below are the promises they made to themselves, to give more power to patient stories.

I started using gas at 13, was kicked out of school at 14 and things started to get worse. I escalated to weed and was kicked out of home at 15. I started using amphets and got into crime/door knocking etc. I began using coke, E's and smack at 17. My life was drugs and crime. 
I have been ready to give up drugs for about 10 years, and it was my daughter who was the catalyst to do something about it. So I cut down on my own before getting in touch with services.

And I am going to rehab tomorrow. The staff are really good, but I wish they would remove their name badges on accompanied visits to town! In general things are good, but there isn't enough to do. There needs to be more staff on at night so that we could to to the cinema, bowling or for a walk. You can get a bit bored. The staff are sound, but there should be more staff who are ex-users, as they can understand better what we are going through. I can relate to them as they have been through it themselves.
The rooms are ok, with a shower and tv, but I think there should be a tv room where all can mix - the staff, and men and women. The beds and food are not too good though.

Firstly please let me apologise for my late response to your opinion, I have had problems logging on! It is nice to hear that your stay in the woodlands was a good one.  I think the points you raised re name badges is a good and simple one.  We encourage staff to have them on their person just in case there is a problem when they are out, you are right they do not need to be so obvious.

I am pleased that Kevin has taken this back to the team.

I will ask the care and environment co-ordinator and our peer support worker to monitor if staff are still wearing badges when out over the next few weeks at the client meetings.

I will post a further response on here with their views/outcomes and will let you know of any changes we do as a result.  

I also see the manager of the unit on a regular basis, my next 1 - 1 is next week, so I will discuss this with him.

"418","Karby3","I started using heroin about 11 years ago. I committed acquisitive crime to fund my habit and had spells in and out of prison. About 2 years ago I decided to try to quit as I hated myself and the life I was leading. I made this decision for myself, because you have to quit for yourself. But the main reason I wanted to quit was for my young daughter who was starting to ask questions. I was seeing a drug worker at Direct Access, who asked me if I wanted to go to The Woodlands. The Woodlands is a brilliant place. You get your own room with a bed, wardrobe and tv. I appreciated having my privacy and my own space; this was really important to me so that I could 'just have an hour' if I was feeling stressed. Also, after meds you can go to your room to sleep so you're not falling asleep in front of people. And we were separated from the girls, which was good. 
The staff at The Woodlands are really good; they treat you with respect. There was an ex-user working as a peer support worker and she was brilliant. Because she had been through it she could understand and empathise with us. She inspired me and modelled what can be achieved.  Every morning I used to go to a group session where we all set our goal for the day. This was a really positive experience as it gave me something to work on throughout the day. Mostly I liked things at The Woodlands, but there were a few things that I didn't like, such as the beds. They had a plastice cover on them and it made you sweat. The food wasn't too good either and there wasn't enough of it. Also I didn't like the smoking cages, they reminded me of jail.
The workers really try hard to make it a positive experience. They take you out into town and take you on bike rides.  I'm going back home soon and I'm determined to keep it up.","rha_721Addiction servicesRHANG3 6AARHA_721servicerha-woodlandsWoodland Inpatient TreatmentRHANG6 9DRRHA_721Nottinghamservice","Last month","the patient","65492","Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustNottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustFirstly, I'd like to thankyou for taking the time to give us this feedback.  Its very heartening to know that not only did you find your experience at The Woodlands a positive one, but we have helped you make such a different in your life!  It's why we do what we do.

We try to treat every service user we see with the respect they deserve.  Having worked in the area for 15 years now I can still only imagine how hard it is to walk through our doors.  As you've found, our peer support worker is invaluable, having experienced working alongside someone with lived experience of substance misuse I don't think we'd ever want to be without peer support workers again.  It also sounds as though you engaged well with The Woodlands recovery programme.

I'm sorry to hear that certain aspects of your care were not up to the same high standard but I hope I can reassure you that we are taking your suggestions further.  We will look into options for the beds:  we have to satisfy infection control standards but there may be ways we can make these more comfortable.  We have smoking shelters currently on order so that our service users are more comfortable and sheltered whilst smoking and we are liaising closely with our kitchens to try and not only improve the quality of the food but also include our service users more closely in the planning of the menus.

Once again, thankyou for your feedback and we all wish you a continued positive recovery.

I have had a drug worker at John Storer and at Castle Key Probation, but have struggled to get of drugs for any length of time.  I am  now almost at the end of my time at the Woodlands, where I have been detoxed from heroin and alcohol.  I will be going to Rehab  in a few days time.  My experience at the Woodlands has been brilliant.  The staff are all good and helpful.  I think it really helps to have workers who are themselves ex-users.  They understand more of what we are going through.  I have had  used some of the therapies and have found them very useful, the relax me and fill time.  
I think that one of the main problems for patients is boredom.  I have gone to the gym every day but even that is closed sometimes. There needs to be more groups that people can attend.  Sometimes there are not enough staff to run the groups they have planned.  I think it would also help if there were staff available to take patients out in the evening to do activities such as going bowling.
I now feel that with the help I have had from the Woodlands that I am now ready to go into rehab.

Unfortunately boredom can become an issue during the detox period, particularly if (as you obviously were) you are ready to ""move on"".  We try to offer as broad a recovery programme as possible at The Woodlands, trying to find something for everyone.  This can be difficult and spread us a little thin at times!  In addition to this we have sufferred from staff sickness in recent months.  I can only apologise for this but please be reassured that our recovery programme is under constant review and your comments will be taken on board.

Firstly please let me apologise for my late response to your opinion, I have had problems logging on! It is nice to hear that your stay in the woodlands was a good one.  I note your view of and Kevin’s response to boredom. We do offer a full range of recovery orientated programmes and activities (I saw a group of service users out on bikes yesterday for example). I will ask the care and environment co-ordinator and our peer support worker to monitor this over the next few weeks at the client meetings.

I will post a further response on here with their views/outcomes and will let you know of any changes we do as a result.  

I also see the manager of the unit on a regular basis, my next 1 - 1 is next week, so I will discuss this with him.

Once again thank you and good luck with your continued recovery.

The staff team including the manager and the peer support worker have had a discussion about this issue this morning following my request for a review of peoples involvement/boredom issues to them yesterday as a direct response from your post.

they have noted that peoples lives on the woodlands are very different from those on the outside side so to speak.  this can lead to people feel bored as they are not as busy as they are in the community. in many instances a persons activities are associated with their addiction. 

This, they have reflected, is an integral part of treatment and they are going to run groups looking specifically at this issue.  The team will  design a specific group that tackles boredom. What boredom actually means, what it means to them and ways to fill time so as not to become bored. We have for sometime been addressing this issue by looking at ways to fill their time when they leave the unit, looking at motivation and hobbies and interests. We do this in one to one sessions and several of the recovery groups.

Your response has prompted us to look at things differently.  

Thank you.

"426","laurenblyton10","After the death of my dad and relationship break down, I turned to drink as a means of coping.

I have an interest in recovery within forensic services, and I also wanted to work in an area that wasn’t so familiar to me.

I had heard a great deal about Wathwood and was keen to discover how recovery and social inclusion was working within a custodial institution.

The General Manager showed me around Wathwood with such pride and indeed the environment that I observed was something to be truly proud of. 

The patients that I talked to were clearly happy in their recovery journey; one young man said to me that he now had value in his life; he was working in the farm shop and benefitting from being a director of this social firm.

The patients volunteered in the hospital shop, the library and the farm shop.  There were many areas where patients could learn new skills and improve their education. NVQ courses were also available in a number of vocational areas.

The staff were clearly very much available to the patients; ‘Releasing Time to Care’ was evident wherever I went.  Staff also appeared to be most keen on supporting patient in their recovery.  I spoke to Lee a gym instructor who had organised a sponsored walk involving the patients, one patient managed to raise £500.  The patients appeared to enjoy being involved in raising money for charity.  Lee spoke strongly about reducing stigma and how putting on such events as sponsored walks helps to reduce the stigma associated with mental health and the hospital itself. 

The hospital library staff were also working closely with the patients in supporting educational pursuits on the Internet and ensuring learning materials were available for the patients and staff.  

I am looking forward to working as a governor ambassador to Wathwood and will offer my support wherever this is needed.

"429","Patient XYZ","After smoking weed every day for 15 years contributed to the end of a long term relationship and a personal breakdown I was left at an all-time low.  Long term depression, paranoia, anxiety and suicidal thoughts were consuming me.
When the suicidal thoughts threatened to become actions, I scared myself into going to the GP to seek help.  After discussion with the GP I started taking Citalopram for depression and was referred to Chill Out Sound Support work on my Cannabis addiction.
Going to the doctors for depression became a problem when I had to change GP’s due to a house move.  At my new GP’s I seemed to end up seeing a different doctor every time I went.  Eventually I got fed up with repeating the same story and gave up on the anti-depressants and the doctors.
Coming off Citalopram in a straight stop didn’t help my mental state and I spiralled into back in anxiety and world avoidance.
The main thing that got me through this last year while my mental state was so up and down was Chill Out Sound Support.  The key was the continuity of seeing the same person every week over a prorogued period of time in a clean, confidential, friendly and relaxing environment.  It allowed me to build up trust with the drug worker which gave me the confidence to discuss my cannabis addiction as well as other issues I didn’t feel comfortable discussing with friends.
Being able to talk to someone face to face every week, who treated me with respect and reasoned with me without judging or belittling me, was exactly what I needed.  The CBT aspects of their counselling worked well.  Now, instead of trying to solve all my problems by smoking more to forget\avoid the world, I eat properly, exercise regularly, see friends more frequently, have a new job and only smoke cannabis very occasionally.
The thing I have to thank them for most is that I’m not sure I would still be here today if it wasn’t for their face to face support and CBT.  They supported me through difficult times, gave me control over my cannabis use and helped me to turn my life around.  I can’t praise these guys enough.

After my latest relapse my wife suggested I try something new and, on my behalf, found out about Chill Out Sound Support via the magic of the interweb.

I have found this service to be an immense help to me. Through weekly counselling sessions they have helped me to empower myself and take responsibility for changing my behaviour.

The counsellors offer help in a non-judgemental atmosphere and provide you with tools to make rational, healthy decisions. They also offer complementary therapies as an adjunct to counselling. I have been having auricular (ear) acupuncture and am really enjoying it; it is the most relaxing half an hour of my week.

"434","Tim Wood","What a night this was.

FOCUS the service user/carer group made up of 12 members that I support were nominated for an award 'Team of the Year (non-clinical)'.

As we walked up the red carpet to the East Midlands Conference Centre a photographer took our photo, this was just the beginning of the star treatment that we all received. 

We were greeted by Dean Fathers (Trust Chair) who made us feel very welcome.  We were then treated to a Champagne and canapé reception (the chicken was great and gluten free). The Champagne was ok although it was difficult to get a glass due to those that were obviously taking full advantage of this kind gesture by our sponsors.

We then went to our table and were treated to dinner prior to the ceremony commencing.

Dean Fathers (Chair) and Mike Cooke OBE (Chief Executive) hosted the evening as a double act and the awards were announced and received by the winners.

However we were all winners that night.  I felt honoured to be able to see the service users and carers that I normally see in my day to day work out enjoying themselves.

The greatest reward for me and one that I hope to remember for the rest of my life was the laughter that was coming from our table due to the joy of having this time together.

I am normally quite a cynic about such things as the OSCARS but this night has proven to me how valuable such events can be.

It appears that mental health issues affecting children are not catered for in mainstream hospitals where it seemed to us that the health professionals really didn't know what to do for my son other than sedate him to prevent chaos on the ward rather than treat him appropriately. I have no argument with the care of the hospital as physical issues are dealt with expediently and effectively, but the treatment of mental health in children appears to me to be an overlooked discipline.
Although the doctors in the hospital tried rigorously, access to specialist services was obstructive in terms of hours of operation and even finding a point of contact. 
Once this had been established and my son referred for help elsewhere his path to recovery was greatly accelerated with the help of willing professionals who were able to put him (and us) at ease and provide skills to help him.

The current ward was commissioned in the 1980’s and designed more as a medical short term facility than for patients with mental health problems who have an longer length of stay. Over the years, our ward footage has been decreased by Nottingham University Hospital when we were under their  trust and with it, the toilet and wash facilities. Unfortunately, while I can thus sympathize with your concerns I can do very little to redress them, our ward footage is not able to expand or the interior be further redesigned. I could suggest that the available facilities are used throughout the day, but I know many of you do this already.

To make everyone aware that the ward will be moving to another facility at Highbury Hospital at the end of the year; the design team have experienced problems of maximizing hygiene facilities with limited floor footage which we have to work around. However, we have been able to include 3 shower areas as well as a bathroom. I have shared this comment on lack of facilities with the new ward design team.

Thank you for your comments it is always helpful to the ward team to hear your concerns and to action them where we can.

I have spoken to the Nottingham University Hospitals catering services and they have said that bacon and eggs would only be provided for patients who are under the care of the dietetic service and have specific health requirements. In brief, they cannot make general provision for everyone and this policy is unlikely to change in this era of cut backs.

They did however point out that on request an all day breakfast can be ordered instead of lunch or tea and I know in the past some of our patients have done this and enjoyed them. If anyone would like to do this, please speak to a member of the nursing staff who will place an order for you.
(For those of you that enjoy the weekly Sunday afternoon buffet this will continue as long as you wish it to.)

The ward and Occupational Therapy department does run a breakfast club, aimed at patients nearing discharge and bacon and eggs sometimes are provided for patients to cook!

Thank you for raising this I am only sorry not to be able to effect any change, bacon and eggs would have been a welcome addition to our diet on the ward.

Thank you for raising the issue of staff time/availability to spend with patients. It is one that has been raised before; we have to balance the duties we have with documentation and computer work and our face to face patient work in our available qualified staffing resourcing. Also we have experienced staff shortages through sickness and retirement recently, which we try to infill with agency or bank staff, but this does not always happen

I am working closely with the staff group with regard to time management and smart working, but as you have spotted we are still struggling. 

I have been very pleased to see the volunteers on the ward and I do hope that once they feel ‘bedded in’ that they will make a real difference to your experience as a patient on B50.

I would like to say thank you to the patient who has had a positive experience during her short time on the ward, it is great for us to receive positive feedback; that we have got the approach right for that person.

This follows on from the previous season’s “It’s OK to talk about it!” anti stigma campaign.

 It’s OK to talk about it’ – The Nottingham Panthers break the ice about mental health

From December 2010, The Nottingham Panthers  joined forces with Nottinghamshire Healthcare on a campaign that aims to break down the stigma surrounding mental health.

The campaign aims to raise awareness of mental health and let the public know that ‘it’s OK to talk about it’.  Mental health affects 1 in 4 people and can happen at any point in life regardless of age, job or background.  The main barrier to seeking help is a reluctance to talk about mental health issues so people often suffer alone and isolated.  The message that ‘it’s OK to talk about it’ is about combating the taboo surrounding mental health and empowering people to ask for help.

The Panthers will be talking about their own experiences of mental health along with people who have used mental health services. Their stories have appeared in the match programmes throughout January, February and March.  Paws the mascot will also  showing his support for the campaign by sporting a special hockey shirt.  Free information and advice about mental health will be available to take away at each game and professionals from the Trust will be on hand to talk about services available and provide help and support.  

Mike Cooke, Chief Executive, Nottinghamshire Healthcare said:  “We’re delighted to be working with the Panthers who are committed to breaking down the prejudices that surround mental health and letting their supporters know that it’s OK to talk about it.  People with mental health problems are often marginalised and can be amongst the most vulnerable in our communities.  The festive period can be a good time to take the opportunity to think of others and to be more understanding.  So why not come along to a match and have fun while learning a little more about looking after your own mental health and considering others.”

Gary Moran, General Manager, Nottingham Panthers, Ice Hockey Team explained why the team is on board:  “We hope we can play a part in helping to get the positive message across to our fans in Nottinghamshire, as mental health issues effect one in four people, it is something that is dear to all our hearts.”

"444","creamcracker","I was referred to Lee at Chill Out Sound Support Nottingham by my frameworker to help manage my addiction to cannabis. 

I began to make the first moves when I realised everything in my life was slipping away from me and I felt like I was having a breakdown. I first got in contact with my GP who put me on medication for my anxiety and depression. I was then referred to Lets Talk Well Being and together they helped me become more stable, which helped me to control my anger and negativity towards life. Whilst this was happening my councillor then referred me to framework which helped me sort out bills, debts and things I’d been hiding away from. These had mounted up for quite some time which had almost resulted in eviction from my property. This took away unnecessary stresses which helped to improve my mental health.

I’ve always struggled with my mental health since I was about 13, or from what I can remember. Using cannabis as self medication and an escape from life’s stresses, which for the first few years genuinely helped. Although as time went on it started to become a way of life, as I turned to it more frequently and became more reliant. I got to a point where I was smoking about 2g a day if not more and it stayed like this day in day out for about 8 years, totalling about £35,000. 

I was referred, by my frameworker, to Lee at Chill Out Sound Support who was welcoming and spoke to me on a level, more like I was a somebody than a nobody.  We spoke about what made me smoke cannabis and how to overcome it. My relationship with cannabis became more of a love hate relationship where I was needy and fiend for the drug to relax and escape, but at the same time caused me to hide away from the world. At first it was used socially, but then I became distant preferring to smoke on my own inadvertently cutting myself off from others. He helped me to structure my life, suggesting exercise and activities to fill my time where cannabis would normally fit and boost my confidence.

My sessions involved acupuncture, as well as councilling, which was not only relaxing but helped me reflect on upcoming tasks, such as reducing my dose and keeping occupied through the day to keep cannabis free until my targeted time of night. I have now cut my dose by more than half and within the next few months will hopefully achieve my target of becoming drug free. Chill Out Sound Support has dramatically improved my life and the way I function. I couldn’t thank Lee enough and all the team, and I hope that this service will always be available to other people who need it.

"446","Cornj6","Hi,  I am a patient at Arnold Lodge.  I thought you might want to hear about our Over 50’s Day that we have on the first Saturday of every month.  There are a few of us oldies who meet up every month and have a really good afternoon.  Bill, the member of staff who runs the group for us, is a book of knowledge, and like us is knocking on a bit!  On these days we all get together, sometimes it’s to watch a film from our era; like ‘On the Buses’, a ‘Carry On’ film or a good old romance!

Bill provides us with popcorn and drinks, sometimes cream cakes, very nice!  Other times we sit around a table and listen to some music from our past like Status Quo, Bay City Rollers and Barry White, to name but a few.  We reminisce about the old days and how we used to live.  Sometimes we talk about when we used to be kids and some of the things we used to get up to and how things have changed over the years.

I think I can say this for everyone who attends the group, “Thanks Bill” for giving up your time to treat us to one day where we can go back in time.  It’s really enjoyable and a pleasure.

"449","Janzq3","The Life to Live Involvement event was all about awareness raising and talking to patients and carers to let people know about services and to tell us what was good about them and what they would like to see improve.
PALS (Patient, Advice & Liaison service) & Involvement shared a stall and spoke to people about the different ways to leave feedback making sure everyone had an opportunity to have their say at the event.
Staff from the Trust and partner organisation were also present including our own Working Age Dementia Service, The Alzheimer's Society & Jigsaw who offer  Befriending and Mentoring for isolated older people.
Andrea Ward-General Manager of Mental Health Service for Older People was there to meet and talk with people. She sums up the event:
''Helping people with dementia to engage and comment on services is very complex and we need to use a range of ways to do this. People with dementia often live in 'the now' rather than what happened last week or yesterday. this event was a great way of supporting the people who use our services and their carers to give us 'real time' feedback and to find out what we can do to support them. Staff have really engaged with the event and for everyone involved there were lots of things to discuss, look at and learn.''

'A great opportunity to network, the displays from partners were really insightful and well presented'.

The leave procedure states that patients should be given a copy of their section 17 form.
In a low secure unit community leave for rehabilitation  is a form of therapeutic risk testing. 
Giving service users a copy of their section 17 form means that they are aware of the parameters of that leave, and can then take responsibility for staying within them. 
The procedure does not enforce that service users have these on their person in the community.
We are sorry if there has been a misunderstanding and hope that this explanation helps. You are welcome to speak with your ward manager if you would like any further clarification.

"456","simag8","We attended the Adult Mental Health Development Forum that the Involvement Centre, Nottingham runs.  It has changed recently so we now visit the AMH (Adult Mental Health) sites and get a chance to discuss the issues that are facing that area.  A recent meeting took place at Psychiatric Outpatients Department, QMC, and was the first time that the group had visited.  It was a fantastic meeting with lots of great ideas and a real honesty about the problems that faced AMH Services operating out of QMC.

The first topic we spoke about was maintenance.  We thought we would go onto speak about lots of other topics that afternoon, but each subject seemed to return to maintenance.  

Something that the group wasn’t aware of was that maintenance of the wards is not carried out by Nottinghamshire Healthcare Trust but the QMC Trust who own the building. Because of this, Nott’s Healthcare wards can sometimes feel second best and not on the priority jobs list when things need doing.

People in the group talked about their own experience of being on a mental health ward at QMC and how their experience of maintenance coming onto the wards was that they tried to do any job as quickly as possible because they felt uncomfortable on a mental health ward.  It was felt that the stigma of mental health needed to be tackled and maybe these members of staff could benefit from some form of mental health awareness training.

The maintenance staff then don’t feedback about the work they’ve done meaning that staff don’t know if it’s been done properly. The group thought that there should be a paper for staff to sign to say the work has been done to their satisfaction and that a job could/could not be considered finished.

One of the most shocking stories the group heard was about a shower that had been sealed off because of mould. The mould is currently being tested to see what it is but preliminary lab results have shown some harmful bacterial cultures.  If left untreated the group were very concerned this could spread to other areas of the ward putting more patients at risk.  The room in question has been sealed off and urgent works requests have been forwarded to rectify this problem.  Who is meant to do the maintenance work and whose responsibility it is, is still being worked out in regards to the shower room.  This has delayed the timely correction of this serious problem and has occurred in the past with other maintenance problems across the mental health wards.  It would appear the two Trusts do not work together efficiently.

There are other issues and concerns around locking off corridors and the upkeep of the garden that were discussed and that we will return to when next at QMC.

The stigma around mental health you mentioned regarding the maintenance staff needs more discussion. If staff are feeling uncomfortable Mental Health awareness training can be arranged. This is a good way of raising awareness and communication between the two Trusts whilst hopefully improving the level of satisfaction of any work undertaken on the ward.

The staff on the AMH wards at the QMC spend a considerable amount of time reporting maintenance issues and ensuring the necessary repairs and improvements to the environment are completed.
The ward environment co-ordinators and the Matron meet with both NUH and NHCT Estates managers every month and conduct a monthly walk around to inspect the ward environments and chase up outstanding works of maintenance needed.  This provides a good audit trail which is then reported back at service level agreement meetings between NUH and NHCT. The service level agreement meetings have recently been redeveloped to provide greater effectiveness in monitoring and managing non-compliance and delays shown in NUH responses to the maintenance needs of the AMH wards. These revamped meetings will be closely monitored by NHCT Estates managers to ensure the AMH wards are getting the level of service needed.
The QMC matron and environment co-ordinators continue to liaise closely with the NHCT SLA monitoring officer to highlight delayed maintenance and speed up responses.
Work has started on the shower room on A42 and is being lead by NHCT Estates.  Before works began, assessment needed to occur on the sources of the problems which were causing the mould and this has taken place and highlighted that unnecessary door seals needed to be removed, deep cleaning was needed along with a correction to the fabrics and ventilation of the room to prevent further problems.
NUH estates and facilities employees work across many departments of the QMC. The domestic services at QMC work well with the AMH wards and have a great rapport and relationship with both patients and staff, however there may be occasions when NUH staff who are unfamiliar with the AMH wards may feel uncomfortable or wary of working with AMH inpatient areas.
The QMC ward managers and matron are going to undertake a piece of work exploring this problem to report back to service managers and general manager and gain involvement in devising an action plan to address this, involving NUH in this project.
Mnay thanks for raising these issues. I hope you will feel reassured that changes and improvements are being made.

"457","Rich79","I was referred to Lee at Chill Out in Nottingham by my GP in January of this year with depression, alcohol addiction, and a dependency on stimulants including cocaine and mephedrone.
From day one, I was treated with repsect and - to my surprise - a realisation of my intellect; never at any point was the tone of the counselling I received patronising or 'dumbed-down'. Gradually, through a process of constructing achievable aims between the two us, each week became a manageable climb towards a point of drug and alcohol abstinence. By week four, I felt I had been re-gifted with control over my own mind and actions, a power I hadn't had, in fact, for a number of years.
I continue to see Lee, and to benefit from half an hour of counselling and half an hour of accupuncture each week, which is a profoundly calming experience and a useful window in a busy week to reflect upon both the positive and the negative aspects of my life.
Crucially, having previously experienced counselling scenarios in which I was made to wait, and rub shoulders, with hardened addicts of 'injected' drugs, it was such a relief to be treated in a space reserved soley for 'recreational' drug misusers, and to be dealt with by a person who was focused specifically on the very different problems faced by people in this category.

Students from the university on placements within Nottinghamshire Healthcare are encouraged to debate for example, the issue of confidentiality within a case scenario. This can then be used as evidence of achievement of portfolio activity. Re-launch of the community of interest has been well received so far and can reach staff such as medical coders whom may often be overlooked.
Executive Director for local services, Simon Smith visited the re-launch of this Community of Interest event at Highbury Hospital Foyer.

By doing this people can influence provision of services by raising issues via debate and everyone can join in with their thoughts and opinions. Topics so far include Waiting Times, a Facebook debate and Recovery. This Community of interest is a partnership between the Trust with our own learning & development team, Lead Nurse Forum & with input and feedback from service user’s and carers also influencing the topics debated.
Some of the comments from the event included:
A mental health services commissioner who dropped in could really see the benefits of gaining service user and career and staff opinion

Gladys Bombek, Trust Governor Member commented that the re-designed publicity material designed by an involvement volunteer was excellent and eye catching.

Dr Stuart Leask proposed that the Trust should identify fifteen minutes a week in staff contracts to devote to activity within the community of interest.

It's been great to see how enthusiastic people get about the Values Exchange when they see how easy it is to use!  Ideas for more scenarios to debate are welcomed.

"461","Janzq3","As a staff member I was able to access training organised by our own Equality & Diversity department on meeting the needs of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller (GRT) communities. 
This was delivered by Astren training. www.astren.co.uk
I was accompanied by a Trust Governor and we heard information about the GRT communities, cultures and lifestyles. It gave us an opportunity to challenge myths and stereotypes and we found out about the impact of inequalities on the lives of GRT communities, particularly around health inequalities and mental health. It was useful to challenge our own feelings and discover we all held some of these prejudices due to lack of knowledge and awareness.
The stigma experienced by GRT communities was highlighted by the trainers one of whom was an English Roma Gypsy with his own business now living in a house due to ill health for part of the year and travelling for the remainder. He was incredibly open and revealing about how society misjudges and excludes these communities based on stereotypes, racism, persecution, exclusion and prejudice.  Highlighting the negative impact of Channel 4’s ‘My Big fat Gypsy Wedding’, he gave an opinion that many of the GRT communities are just not like the people portrayed in the programme and it gave the wrong impression having focused on Irish travellers only which is just one aspect of this marginalised community.
What struck us about the training was the opportunity to raise awareness within our Trust and involve these communities. The best way to do this is to go to the communities, a problem in itself as people are so wary that we have to work at building relationships first.
After the training we talked about how to take this further having been so impressed with the course content and quality of the trainers and plan to raise awareness with other staff about the issues faced by GRT communities. We would like to try to reduce some of the stigma associated by telling others about this invaluable training.
And a final pause for thought…
GRT communities are five times more likely to have health problems than other groups and 20 times more likely to have experienced the death of a child and 80% face mental health issues.

Thank you for your posting. I am really glad that you enjoyed the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller (GRT) Awareness Training. You gave a very informative and honest account of your training experience which is very much appreciated. I hope it encourages other staff, governors, involvement volunteers etc to attend future training sessions and/or learn more about the rich and varied culture of our GRT Communities. 

Very little positive information is heard in the media about people from GRT communities and having such informed knowledge enables us to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices we often see and hear, helping create a society which is more understanding and supportive of one another.61334Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustRHA613252012-02-29T16:43:03.987po","Procedureafter careConditionmental health","Gypsy, Roma and Traveller ( GRT) Communities Training","","2012-02-29T15:28:34.143","","po"

"465","Janzq3","Staff, service users, carers, and volunteers from Nottingham & Rosewood Involvement Centres got together to talk about increasing the amount of LD involvement in interviews. The group wanted to remind all staff from the Trust to include involvement in ALL staff interviews  for all service areas and not just LD.

Interview courses were designed to train people with learning disabilities including lots of role-play to practice interviewing techniques looking at every aspect of the interview process. 

More that 20 people with LD accessed the 2 courses with plans for a third later this year.

Feedback from interviews since the course from people with learning disabilities: 

‘I think it's made a real difference to me I feel involved in something really important’.   
‘It’s made me more confidant, I used to think involvement was just for show where interviews were concerned but I have been proved wrong and can see how good it’s been for me’, 
‘I had a meeting with George prior to the interview and he helped me to prepare to be part of a panel’.
‘I think we need to tell the interview panel more about ourselves so they are prepared when they meet us and will be able to be better informed about our abilities.’
‘Roddersforest’ said, I have practised interview techniques in preparation for interviews.'
‘I felt really important and proud of taking part in interviews’.
Everyone agreed that no interview should take place in the Trust for any post without service user and carer involvement
‘We should be equal members of the panel’.
Service users also asked to be given enough time to prepare their own questions as preparing for an interview is really important 

Equality and diversity was a crucial part of the course with all members at the get together refreshing their knowledge with a quiz that was set by our Head of Equality & Diversity - Catherine Conchar.

Other opportunities for involvement are open to all service users and carers involved in interviews. People from the courses are also getting involved in audits for the Trust such as visiting inpatient areas to check on cleanliness, food standards and infection control for example. Others have joined the Nottingham Recovery College to develop their skills even more.

""We could do with more advocacy so we can talk to someone independent about our needs""
We have current increased our advocacy service and have a male and female advocate who are available throughout the week and they attend the patients forum every two weeks.  We also have an Imam, Catholic Priest and non denominational Chaplin attending Wednesdays and Fridays who make themselves available to all patients if the want to discuss private issues.  This forum of the patient’s opinion site will also allow individuals raise issues and needs and they can be discussed openly but anomalously.  If the needs can be addressed in hospital please speak to your named nurse or OT or attend the patients forum or weekly community meeting held on the ward.  Alternatively you could write a letter to the Matron in the hospital or ask staff to locate the numbers for a solicitor who can act as an advocate.
' I've been here a year, not sure how I feel as I've been excluded form the outside world. I think I've improved but that may be down to the medication'. I have 1:1 time with therapists and staff.'

 Mike Cooke our Chief executive agreed to allocate a budget to drive healthy living at Arnold Lodge in 2009. In 2010 we became a Community of Interest for Health & Well-Being.

‘As part of our Community of Interest Health & Well-being group we run activity sessions for patients at Arnold Lodge. The purpose of the activity is to encourage making healthier choices

Managing weight, Education, Activity and Support over a 12 week programme.

 

Patients shared some of their thoughts about the activity sessions.

 

‘It’s brilliant – I give it a’10 out of 10!’

It keeps you feeling well and good about yourself 

‘It helps when you are feeling sluggish’. 

‘I like being in the fresh air, it warms you up and give you enthusiasm and breaks down barriers’

 

The work has brought about so many benefits for Arnold Lodge and is sponsored by Ruth Hawkins our executive director for finance & performance

 

The programme covers lots of things such as:

 

·        Individual/Group sessions

● Educational workshops

● Cognitive Behaviour Therapies

● Exploring Barriers

● Introduction to fun physical activities

● Physical/Fitness assessments

● Review Diaries

● Nutritional Education

● Healthy Cooking Workshops

 

Plans for extending the benefits include:

Sharing good practice across the Trust and rolling it out in other services within the Trust.

Adapt the Health and Wellbeing Programme for staff wellbeing and market its success to outside agencies such as County Health Partnerships and Offender healthcare.

The plan is to meet up every month to see what comes from the group and see how it can develop.
The idea came from a group that played christmas Carol. On that occasion people also learned to use sign language to sing the twelve days of Christmas. It would be nice if the group could learn another song to sign to.

Music is a great way of communicating good way to interact and have fun.","rhaNottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustRHANG3 6AANottinghammental health trust","Yesterday","a service user","60446","Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Thank you for sharing your story about the positive aspects of involvement volunteers getting together.

Many suggestions were made, including comic books, pizza and revolving displays. After much deliberation, we went with the idea of having a DJ playing 'records' and paper 'fortune- tellers' (design based on the DJ).

Hot topics for today included the menus, activities and what patients felt about the ward and staff.
One patient felt that there was not enough food of your choice available so depending on when you are served you may not get what you really want to eat. 
Ward staff  were present in the meeting to tell everyone that patients could pick an alternative from an extra choice menu available if ordered the day before.
Jake was attending the meeting as a student nurse on his first placement and commented on his impressions of B50.
'I love it, staff are brilliant, I feel really welcome, and patients have lots of activities to take part in, this has been a perfect place to start my placement'.
Other patients echoed Jake's comments, staff are nice, we have plenty to do, Diane is our activity co-ordinator and we requested a pamper day which is being organised. Everything works well on the ward. Josh,  an agency staff member said
' I love it here and feel I have fitted in well even though I was nervous to start with.'

""To all of the staff who work on Ward B2
I wanted to write this to you all and know that you not only read the words but take them with you.  I also want you to know that as I write each word, I am getting more and more well.
I joined you on 9th November 2011 as a very frightened and confused person.  On that morning, I was taken away from the class I was teaching and from a school where I had worked at for almost fifteen years.
I tried to force myself to believe that when I arrived here I was okay albeit a little tired and perhaps a bit stressed.
My family and friends urged me to write a daily diary as a means of communication and so they could understand my thoughts a bit more clearly.  An excerpt from that diary dated Tuesday 29th November 2011 said ‘I have been here for twenty days, they have been twenty of the most frightening and deeply disturbing days of my life.  I have cried more tears, screamed more screams, laughed more insanely and felt more hopeless and alone that I probably have during my entire existence on this planet’. 
I realise now that through the absolute safety, brilliant care and endless compassion you gave me I was able to break down totally.
At one point, I thought that I had ‘lost my mind’.  I now know that each of you took turns to previously hold a little piece of it for me and then slowly handed it back to me bit by bit. 
My once fragmented mind has come together and although fragile will be okay.  I know I still have a long way to go to recovery fully but my recovery until now has been due to you all.
I can not ever put in to words the thanks and appreciation I feel.  I would like to thank you all but would like to write a few words to some of you in particular.
Cheryl – you are one of the most compassionate human beings I have ever had the honour to meet, thank you.
Danielle – you have helped me more than you will probably ever know, thank you.

Lisa – you lit up my days here and really made me remember how to truly laugh, thank you.

Dawn – I always heard you before you arrived!  You really grounded me, you are so real and you helped me re-learn how to live, thank you.
Chris – you gave such brilliant advice and would always listen without making a judgement, thank you.
Stacey – (whom I will remember as Tigger!)  Stay being the amazing nurse that you are, you touch people’s lives everyday.
Simon – what a ward manager!
And lastly my lovely Jill – well I thank god everyday for you Jill.
When I am fully recovery I will put back in to the Mental Health Service all I had once been given.
Until then, have a wonderful Christmas and best wishes for the years ahead.
With much love and respect.""

Instead my needs are met with no prejudice and advice which I can take if I think its good but not if I don't think it is good.

"500","james w","For the past several years I have had a problem with a alcohol dependency. It finally got really out of hand over the past year. It was causing me serious problems in my marriage and family relationships as well as my health. My life seemed a total wreck and beyond help, but I knew I had to do something. I have been going to the Community Alcohol Service at Newark on a weekly basis for the past few years, I have tried on my own to stop drinking many times, but failed. It was through my alcohol support worker that referred me to have a detox at The Woodlands. I came in October for an assessment, eventually I was admitted in late November. I know it is still early days, but after over a month I have not touched any alcohol, and my life and general health is much improved. I still however get a strong desire at times to want a drink, but I since I am taking antabuse I know what would be the consequences if I had a drink, it is a good deterrent.
My stay at The Woodlands has helped me to have a second chance in life, and make a fresh start. The facilities there are first class and provide a warm and friendly environment. The staff are fantastic and looked after me very well, I felt so much at home that I did`nt want to leave. You all do a great job and I thank you all so much for the help and the support that I have been given.","RHA_721Addiction servicesRHANG3 6AARHA_721service","Last month","the patient","57359","Rod Hudspith, Woodlands Manager, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustRod Hudspith, Woodlands Manager, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustDear James W

The psychiatrist said that no one would visit me at home.  When I said that I felt I was getting nowhere because of the breaks in my care, they agreed and discharged me.

I read your posting just now and it is clear that you have not been able to find the right support to help you, particularly in relation to your agoraphobia. 
I am sorry you feel there is no point in asking for help as I know many of the people working in adult mental health would want to  try and  bring about a solution to the issues you raise.
 I have passed on your posting to adult mental health service for comment.  
We appreciate your honest feedback

"520","nigelg","I am a service user and I am very proud to say the Rosewood Centre Manager (how's that for Involement!)

Last week we celebrated our 3rd Birthday at the Rosewood Centre. What a great day and as always full to capacity, our very own Patron and Chief Exsecutive Mike Cooke CBE, just like day 1,  was on hand and helped us with our celebration by hosting Catch up with Cooke'. The Catch up sessions give service users, Carers, Members of our Trust and Staff a chance to ask the ' top man ' any questions and I do mean any questions. What a great way to kick off our 3rd birthday bash. 

We invited some Trust staff who have been great supporters of Involvement and Rosewood, these included our Genaral Manager from AMH County and Sector managers and a true friend from Wathwood Hospital ( ward Manager). We could of course have invited a great many however our Service users and Carers come 1st and so we could only invite a few Staff due to being full. I wanted to thank ALL the fantastic People who have visited us and supported us over the 3 years and have made Involvement, makeing change happen the norm'. Thank you to you all and Thank you always Mike Cooke for believing in real Involvement and for believing in me.

Below are comments we received on the day, all are service users and or Carers:

*In some ways I feel I have had a positive experience and in some ways I have had a negative experience, I feel I had a good relationship with my psychiatrist and I appreciated the way she communicated with me. I saw a psychologist for quite a while and felt that I could communicate well with him , and gained more insight into things. 

On the other hand I haven't had any other support from mental health services when I have been in a crisis situation and to help me with changes and moving forward. However I am reluctant to get help anyway because I feel I will have less control and worry about being given loads of medication. I have been welcomed by the rosewood centre and feel the involvement works and opportunities on offer are the way to go. Also there is a supportive atmosphere which is beneficial to everyone. Much of the help I have received has been from the community resource centre at Worksop too.

*During my time at the rosewood involvement centre I have been amazed by all of the positive things going on.
I was made to feel welcome and at home since my very first visit. The rosewood facilitates the principles of hope, control and opportunity and embraces diversity.
It has been a real pleasure to be part of such an organisation. Change is going to happen for the better thanks to everyone at the centre and the amazing work they do!

*getting involved is helping me with recovery. I really love being part of the Rosehips belly dancers. .

*going to the drop in group helps me to get out and socialise. The belly dance group has given me confidence and helped my self esteem. I've made lots of friends, lost some weight, it's been a wonderful experience.

*Came to photograph the people at rosewood and 'catch up with cook' fantastic experience again! Well worth coming and listening to people's stories and also being acknowledged as part of the rosewood experience. BRILLIANT XXX thank you xxx

*Coming to rosewood has changed my life being involved with its 3rd birthday, it's just great to be with all the new friends and staff who make the day such a nice one and I am glad to be part of rosewood.

"522","Janzq3","The involvement team visits the patient and carer meeing on Ward B50 every 2 months and gathers feedback from patients. Here are some of the things people said about the ward:

Diane is now our activity co-ordinator and since she came things have improved. We have more buffets and it is nice to be able to go back down to the gym again. I feel stronger and there is a social relaxing atmosphere. Jane the physio is good.

it is a great shame that there are no volunteers yet on the ward as I think this would free up staff to spend more time with patients and families for 1:1 meetings.

Food is excellent, there is plenty to eat

I think ID badges should be re-designed to be clearer with larger lettering and photos but I like the fact that staff don't wear uniforms.

Medication is handled very professionally on the ward. Staff show us medication leaflets and offer time to talk about medication.

Sue told us about involvement in care plans with the patient, carers, families and staff all working together. Sue said  of course this was with our permission as patients.

It is good to have positive comments about the care patients receive, especially when in previous months patients have suggested our practice might be improved, (Row713).
So to read your comments on the ways staff have taken time to discuss medications with patients and giving out leaflets I feel shows we are willing to listen and improve. I was especially pleased to see that you like our approach with regard to devising Involvement Care Plans with you and your families, with your agreement. Sue has worked hard to try and embed this into the way we work on the ward. 
 
I note your comments that volunteers would be helpful in the ward and they would indeed be able to participate in social acitivites with patients. I have been in contact with the Trust lead on volunteers and he is working to recruit suitable and keen volunteers for us!
 
The ID badges being clearer/larger photographs is a tricky one, in that having to carry a badge around at all times, a larger badge might not be entirely practical. But i could enquire if work might be done on redesigning the badges. Perhaps we could use a more visable and simple name tag on our collars. This had been in practice a year or so ago, but lapsed. Would it help to resurrect it? The ward does have a large staff photo board with names and title by the nursing office door and i hope this will help you to put names to faces.
 
Thank you for taking the time to use Patient Opinion, it helps us to look at the issues that are important to you as a patient and improve our service in a way that is meaningful to you who use it.
 
I will post any updates regarding badges and the volunteer situation.

"525","Yogi","The new catering arrangements that, in my opinion, has became a sore point for patients is causing much frustration between patients and staff on wards. 

The causes are that on some occasions the new menus are not getting delivered to the wards on time or being lost, then wards getting blamed for them not being sent in, right to the state of cleanliness of the dining room used by Ridgeway and Cannock. 

To make a point, we had Health and Safety people come round. A fellow peer pointed out the state of uncleanliness of the dining room, promises of it will be done, next meal time. Same day no change. still dirty. With instances like this I feel that is no wonder we had an outbreak of D and V earlier this year. 

I think you should bring back patients being allowed to use disinfectants like it used to be, at least we know things will be clean and safe!","RHA_710iInpatient mental health careRHANG3 6AARHA_710iservice","Last six months","the patient","56661","Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Thank you for your posting.

Thank you for sharing your feedback. As part of the new catering arrangement, patients are asked three times a week to order their lunch and evening meals.

This has created a few issues for staff and patients as occasionally  paperwork can go missing between the time the paperwork is delivered to the ward (evenings), and the time the orders are collected (following morning).  It is essential that any missing information is replaced, so we ask the patient to complete the menu order form again. This is because if no information is received, the Catering Department won’t place the order so this means there is potential for the patient not getting a meal.

The administration has been raised as an issue for both nursing and catering staff and it has been agreed that the Hotel Services Manager and Ward Managers will get together to try and resolve the issue.

The Catering Service work closely with Ward Staff to try to ensure that the meals provided are correct and so that we can reduce the incidences of staff getting the blame, when orders are mislaid. We do however; try to stress the urgency for submitting the order with when the deadline for ordering food is approaching.

With reference to the health and safety issue, we did recently have an unannounced visit from the City Council’s Environmental Health Department.  They visited the kitchens and dining areas during the lunchtime service and a patient did point out an issue related to the cleanliness, which unfortunately, took more than a day to rectify.  The Catering Supervisor does make daily checks of the kitchen and dining areas to ensure high standards of cleanliness are maintained.

We are pleased to report that following the Environmental Health visit the report stated that the hospital had a rating of 5, which is the highest rating that can be achieved.  The rating can be viewed on the Food Standard Agency website.

We hope our meeting will resolve some of the problems you are experiencing

I am leaving the Therapeutic Community at The Mandala Centre  in the next few weeks. Part of me is apprehensive but part of me is excited as I am getting my life back on track.
The turning point came a couple of months ago. Going to the involvement showcase at Trent Vineyard in Nottingham  was an amazing day. I was daunted when I walked in not expecting such a huge event.There was not the stigma I have  experienced in other places. I came back inspired having picked up a lot of information about volunteering. I felt the support being offered via involvement is different. ...I felt I was understood .
Nigel moved me to tears in his presentation when talking about how he was feeling on the day. He was someone who had been through mental health services and come out the other side as an employee of the Trust.  This story was incredibly powerful.
The trust is obviously open to holistic therapies. It not about just volunteering it is about expanding your whole life. This was the message I took away and the volunteering that is being done is brilliant

"534","DRE93","Hi, 
I've recently started a Apprenticeship at the Involvement Centre @ Duncan Macmillan house, Nottingham. I didn't know what to expect with coming into contact with Service users or even staff members. 
Well the day arrived, I was sitting in reception waiting for a staff member to come and collect me to show me around where i was about to be for the next 15 months. I arrived into the centre, it had a homely feeling to it, a place that can welcome anyone and the staff members were very nice and welcoming which they meet and greeted me into the team. They also showed me and explained what 'Involvement' is, what is consists off. They also gave me the 'Tree Book' - this had brief explanations on what groups and events were held by the Involvement team and centre. 
Then a service user came in and i got introduced to him then i had a talk with my 1st service user which was a nervous experience of what not to say or what to say. 
The 1st few weeks flew by, easing my way into the role and getting into the roll of things, of job duties. The service users are the nicest people you could ever meet. They are one the best bit of the job. To have a conversation with them and to see what they're up to at the weekend or even if its having a laugh with one of them - thats the best perk to the job here.  
I look at some of the Service users around here and i honestly think they are inspirational of what they have been through or are even still going through - its a real honour being in their company! 
Im currently 4/5 months to my apprenticeship - i can honestly say i like it here but being in an office and being in contact with service users has made me realise i want to become a Support Worker or Care worker so hopefully i can gain experience being here or even get onto a course to gain some health & social skills. 
I feel like i can help out more being more active than sat behind a desk because i feel like i have a good understanding of what they are going through or have been through.

It is good to hear that you feel the treatment you are receiving is good and we are always interested to hear how we can improve and develop activities that will help you. You have highlighted several activities that you would like to pursue and if you could discuss these with your named Occupational Therapist, they can then help you to pursue some or all of these. I have let her know that someone on Thurland Ward has expressed these interests, so please talk to her about what you would like to get involved in and what would help you. 

We have had Tai Chi sessions in the Well’s Road Centre before and if you have leave it may be something that you can pursue in the community.

There are currently some cooking groups on the ward and requests to prepare regional menus will be well received in these.

Your named Occupational therapist will be able to discuss opportunities for volunteering and introduce you to the Art Instructor, who will discuss with you how you would like to be involved in Therapeutic Art.

Once again thank you for letting us know your views and what will help you with you recovery.

I would urge you to come forward and speak to myself or the Deputy Ward Manager if you feel able.  We could then look at the process around prescribing/dispensing medications and specific drugs that you may need more information about; it may be more appropriate, especially if the drugs are for medical conditions, if queries are answered by our more knowledgeable medical colleagues or the ward pharmacist.

The organisation aims to raise awareness of how disabling paranoia can be and to breakdown social taboos. The Network runs training sessions globally to professional bodies and all interested parties on how to understand a person's paranoia and help them make sense of it.
The National Paranoia Network is a voluntary organisation to support people who express paranoia and unusual beliefs. The organisation is run by people with self experience of paranoia and hearing voices.
The Paranoia Network visited an event at The Crossing in Worksop October 8th 2011 and displayed lots of information on their stall about the work of the network. Staff from Nottinghamshire Healthcare attended the day to promote positive mental health.
Peter Bullimore summed up the day and the work of the network: ‘Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.’ (Margaret Mead - American cultural anthropologist).

On ward B2 we aim to provide the highest standard of care possible and believe that this is achieved by investing in all elements of the ward team. This ethos can be seen in the following comments from student evaluations received via the University of Nottingham between July and October 2011.

All staff were welcoming and friendly. A great team to work with. (1009)

Every staff member made a real effort to make me feel welcomed and part of the team and got me involved in all aspects of patients care. (0809)

I was made to feel extremely welcome by all members of staff on the placement and if I had any questions every staff member would do their best to help me. (0809)

Everyone from the ward manager to nursing staff were always willing to help and add to my experience. They all learned me how to adapt to a adult acute ward. (1009)

Both my mentors charge nurse ward manager and all other members of staff gave me feedback on my practice which was extremely helpful and built my confidence. (0809)

Staff are brilliant everyone always helped me out and were friendly and willing to learn me new things. A top class committed team who work To a very high standard of practice in a brilliant enthusiastic atmosphere. I loved every minute of this placement. (1009)

All members of the team were supportive of students and I was made to feel a member of the team. I could approach any member of staff with a question and felt that they did their best to answer and support this. (0809)

Another useful aspect was that the ward fuctions fantastically as a MDT which enabled me to work closely with community teams doctors and non statutory services. I was also given the opportunity to buddy a fellow student which I found to be useful as it enabled me to begin to understand how important the mentor role is. (0809)

I couldn't have wished for a better placement. 5 stars. (1009)

'We would love to go swimming as I struggle to do things. I don't walk very well but I would happily make a contribution to use a pool. I wonder why QMC doesn't have its own pool for patients'. Could we use a pool nearby such as the university pool on the doorstep of QMC?
'I would like to go out for more fresh air'.
'Can we have morning or afternoon appointments to see the consultant?  At the moment we sometimes have to wait all day to see the doctor. I am a heavy smoker and this means I have to wait a long time to have a cigarette'.
We would like to get out and about a bit more, we once went to Highfields Park and had a picnic.
'More fresh air and walks outside would help.'

Jane54836Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust RHA542812011-10-27T14:48:02.653poInvolvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust The work of the involvement team with the patients on B50 has raised many issues that the staff team have been pleased to resolve where we can.
The availability of off ward activities, swimming and access to fresh air has been raised by patients previously. Staff share these concerns as it helps with recovery.

If and when patients feel ready to get back into their usual level of activity it is important that the resources are there to help. However, our allied health professionals Occupational Therapy and Physio team have recently had a service review. This means we have lost some resources and staff time. Our patients feel this quite acutely as the activity programme is more restricted. Our part time Occupational Therapist was off sick, causing a reduction in the service, but the good news is that she is now back at work. 

We recently lost our activity coordinator as she has moved onto pastures new, proving a real blow to our activity programme. The good news is that one of our own Healthcare Assistant’s has been successful in securing a secondment to the position starting 14/11/11, so I am hopeful that we can increase the level of activities that we offer.

Can I just mention that for those patients who are fortunate to have visits by relatives and friends who live locally, you can make use of your time together by going off ward? There are café’s in the QMC main entrance and a small garden by the medical school entrance that provides a pleasant outlook and a change of scenery.

The idea of patient appointments having specific times was recently raised with the consultant. This has already been actioned; the consultant now makes a list of patients that she can see on ward round days and these are posted in the day room. Unfortunately, times are approximate, as you are aware some patients need more time with her than others. So thank you for your patience.

Thanks to all the patients who use the Patient Opinion site. It helps us make a difference to your care whilst you are with us in hospital.

It is good to know that you continue to engage in treatment and your recovery in such an enthusiastic manner and that your plans for the remainder of your stay at The Woodlands and after discharge are very optimistic. I was also pleased to hear you discuss your treatment and progress to date so positively;your future seems very bright.

"558","Sarah Rose","I became unwell in 2001 after the death of my father, we had been very close. I was admitted to Bassetlaw Hospital Ward B2 and sectioned with a diagnosis of depression and psychotic episodes.
External events were giving me lots of strange delusions - I started to think that national disasters and news events were my fault or linked to me. It was a frightening time. I was very paranoid, I trusted no one, not even family members. I went to hospital voluntarily, but ran away from the ward and was later sectioned because of my suicidal thoughts.
Eventually I was released but the strain broke up my marriage. Despite the stress of that I started to recover as I had two young children to bring up, and they were reliant on me.
Since then I've had two repeat episodes caused by work related stress. I lost both jobs as a result. After the third incident I was diagnosed with Bipolar Affective Disorder.
This time I became positive about my recovery and after looking for a support group in the Bassetlaw area and not finding one, I went on to set up a support group with the assistance of staff from within the trust. The group is called Equilibrial (on my wavelength).
Now I feel good about myself, my self esteem has rocketed. I can monitor my own condition and help others through the group. More recently I have trained as a Peer Support Worker and am now employed by the Trust.","RHA_710Adult mental healthRHANG3 6AARHA_710service","Today","the patient","53918","Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Thank you for sharing your story.

After about 3 weeks I felt better and talked them out of the section and was able to get more freedom to go out and about. I was there about 3 months.

Having attended the patient group a few weeks back, we are now planning times for when patients are seen by the Consultant or Registrar in the wards and the nursing staff have put up a white board in the day room so that we can write down who will be seen and at what time that day. I will be very keen to hear if this is helpful. 
We will also be putting up a timetable each week of when patients can expect medical staff to be attending the ward and give a bit more information reagrding the levels of exeprience and roles and duties of the doctors that are currently looking after them.54582Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustRHA536432011-10-21T15:39:58.23po","","Doctors appointment times on the ward","","2011-10-02T18:47:23.81","","po"
"561","Janzq3","Bearing in mind how nursing staff are always on the go,  it can sometimes be very frustrating if you have a very immediate problem to sort but cannot gain immediate access.
Could I suggest that 1 staff member on the ward be available as a nominated 'listener' (every other half hour or something?).","RHA_715Older people's mental healthRHANG3 6AARHA_715service","Last week","the patient","53642","Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust I can understand the frustration that staff always appear busy, and yes, there are a number of reasons that contribute to a heavy workload at present that I would like to share with you. We have some staff off sick and a `limited budget to cover this with other staff (or sometimes no staff) provided by the NHS Professionals nursing agency.

Lots of the current inpatient group have physical health problems and high nursing dependency needs which take a priority, including escort to physical health tests. I can see why we always seem on the go because we are!

But what can we all do to make this better for everyone?

Firstly, we can talk about this in a patients meeting so that staff and patients can discuss difficulties and find solutions together including how we might encourage patients to make an approach to us to discuss concerns. Perhaps we could look at patients approaching any grade of staff; the HCA’s are excellent listeners and able to offer support or relay concerns to trained staff. 

Secondly, I will raise the issue in a staff meeting about us looking at ways to increase our availability; considering the suggestion already made and how that might happen .

Thirdly, for trained staff to utilise the ‘named nurse’ time to best advantage, to make appointments with their patients. (Each patient has an allocated nurse on admission and the nurses name is written on the notice board over the patients bed)

Ward demands are variable and unfortunately we are at its mercy, but we will do our best to present a more ‘listening face’.

Sometimes leave is limited as risks have to be taken into account. These decisions are often made in ward reviews with the consultant and patient.

After admission, leave may be limited, but as time goes on and things improve, leave may become more available meaning family and friends can escort their loved ones off the ward or they may be able to have unescorted leave.

Perhaps this area needs further discussion and awareness raised by staff with friends and family, so that they can talk in more detail about the time off ward with their loved ones. 

Staff do try and support escorted leaves, but our time is often taken up by the care needs of the ward patient group. With the recent changes to Occupational therapy and Physio services hours being reduced this has added to the problem. Unfortunately our Activity Coordinator has recently resigned so escorted leaves have been further reduced. 

With this in mind other avenues are being looked at by the ward manager to see what role volunteers may play to facilitate trips out. We have made contact with our voluntary services in the Trust to express an interest in establishing voluntary roles to ease the situation.

Communities of Interest are about changing and improving NHS services. All were passionate about helping people with Mental Health Problems into employment and providing good support. Welfare rights proved a hot topic with people talking about good education for employers including our own occupational health service to help them make better informed decisions when making assessments. Support was also discussed for existing NHS employees who become unwell and need understanding from the organisation to manage their mental health and recovery.
Best practise was a key focus. Suggestions were put forward for providing a forum for people to bring questions to the group. The Trust Voluntary 
services attended the meeting as many of our service users often use volunteering as a stepping stone to employment. 
Health awareness training was discussed both for prospective employers and our own staff.

I work with the acute liaison team for Nottinghamshire Healthcare based at City & QMC.
I train medical staff about patients with learning disabilities, about the anxiety they might have and how the medical staff can help make people feel netter. 
We devised the traffic light system
Red is important information, contact details, next of kin, allergies
Amber is all about how to support me while in hospital, like toiletting, personal hygiene, and medicines
Green is likes and dislikes, for example someone might be nervous of needles or a mask or like their food moist. It also means that the doctors and nurses can talk to people about what they like while they're having treatment which helps keep the patients calm.
It's really important to me because I've had a bad experience in the past (with doctors touching my eyes without asking for my permission, and a locum doctor who showed that he had no faith in me recovering from cancer because I had a disability) and I believe people with learning disabilities should have equal rights to good healthcare. We're not asking for more, just equal. 
I love my work, I've always wanted to work in health and now I'm doing it. In the future I'm hoping to go into wards with iPads to ask people with learning disabilities how their treatment and care is going, and if they have what they need.

Thank you for sharing your story on Patient Opinion- your work with people with learning disabilities at the City and QMC hospitals is invaluable. The Learning Disabilities Service strongly believes that by sharing experiences/stories such as yours is crucial in deciding how we shape and review our services. The service has strong links with the Trust’s involvement department and positively values the knowledge, skills and experiences of our service users, carers and the public. An example of this is the use of “Listening to You” posters as we believe this allows people to comment on our services and by listening together we can make a difference.

"568","JY2K","I suffered very badly with Agoraphobia, and was bored at home. I wanted to do more with my life but wasn't sure how to and wasn't sure I could do it. I was referred to Sue at the Education Recovery Centre who pushed me, in a good way! She listened to me, understood what I wanted to achieve and helped me make plans for how to do it. I told her that my goal was to go to University.
She persuaded me to take courses through the Open University, which I did for two years alongside having CBT sessions. The combination of the OU course and the CBT helped me so much, and got me to a point where I could control my agoraphobia.
I applied to University and Sue wrote down all the options for what would happen if I didn't get in or if things didn't go to plan. I'm now in my third year and will graduate next summer. I no longer use services from the trust, but am still in the system if I need any help in the future but I don't think I will. I feel 100 times better.
I honestly believe that without the help I got from Sue and the trust, I wouldn't have made it to University. I'm so grateful and now have a real future. Thank you.

The alcohol stopped me facing up to things and I lost the plot. I went to see the GP with my wife. It all fell apart and I came clean. Counselling was offered. I was VERY sceptical at first and defensive.

The way Oxford Corner staff are trained and what they do for people is amazing.

What they did was make you look at things differently. They took me apart piece by piece and put me back together again. I’m a convert to this type of service as having someone who is removed from the situation was the solution.

If I won the Euro millions I would have given Oxford Corner a million quid!

Everything is done to a plan. They helped me to take a step back and ease back into life.

My story is that I was made redundant from a sales job because of the recession and spent a lot of time lying about at home, bored and depressed. I began to drink and fell out with my wife over my laziness and left home to sort my alcohol problem out. In three weeks I lost my job, wife and home.

I want to start again now and have the enthusiasm to try it – to try anything really, from exercise to working at a job again.

If Oxford Corner wasn’t here I would be in my bedroom drinking 16 pints per day. They have done a brilliant job and got me down from 16 to 4 pints of Stella per day. The one-to-one meetings are brilliant and having the support to know that I don’t have to do it all by myself helps me work on my depression which was the trigger for my drinking.  They give me the option of seeing somebody every day.

I have just come out of hospital and, at the moment, am sleeping at my parents who also give me support. Today I started medication which cancels out the effect of the alcohol so there is no point taking it.”

Firstly, sorry for the delay in replying to your posting about waiting times and specifically about the length of time that you had to wait between seeking help for your alcohol problem and the date of your assessment at Oxford Corner.
As a service we are also concerned about this long wait and we are treating this issue as a priority and one which we are trying hard to resolve. Our current waiting time is 5 weeks and we acknowledge that this is not good enough.
Only last week we met with our commissioners within the Primary Care Trust to discuss this issue. They are fully aware that Oxford Corner is struggling to meet the increasing demand of new referrals and are equally concerned and are keen to support us with potential solutions. 
If you want to I discuss this issue further with the Oxford Corner Manager or raise your concerns via our Service User Panel then we are more than happy for you to do so. The contact number for Oxford Coner  is Tel:0115 948 5505
Thank you for your feedback

"574","Jimbo123","My son was given a custodial sentence in HM Prison Nottingham for theft. His drug addiction was driving his criminal behaviour. Once in prison he decided to use the stay there as an opportunity to reduce his methadone dosage to zero at a point in time to coincide with 6 weeks to go before his release.  That would mean on leaving prison he would have been methadone free for 6 weeks. This was important to him so that he was fighting fit for the challenge of turning his life around.
 In order to implement this plan he needed an appointment with the prison doctor to set a reduction rate. The delay in being seen by the doctor has now made implementation of this strategy impossible because so much time (5 weeks) has been lost.
 I feel a missed opportunity has occurred because of failure to give priority to the situation. The effect this has had is to demotivate him and reduced his chance of making the change he needs to on this occasion. He feels he has been willing to take the pain of reducing methadone to zero and feels he has been let down by the system.
  I want know why this has happened. I would hope that in these circumstance the services would see it as a priority to support someone who is clearly making all the right effort.

"575","Blackcat","My son turned 13 and became what everyone described as a typical teenager.  I was told by everyone that his erratic behaviour was typical, but eventually did not believe it and took him to see his GP, believing my son to be clinically depressed or bipolar.  His GP referred him to Nottinghamshire CAMHS and from then on things gradually began to get better.

Initially my son did not want to visit CAMHS, he was rude to the Psychiatrist, he would not see the therapist, he did not want to take prescribed medication.  Anything that could be fought against, was.

It took a number of months for my son to agree to take his medication, but once he had started things began to improve.  He was on anti-depressant medication for 10 months, but it helped him cope.

In addition to battling depression, my son was also diagnosed with body dismorphic disorder.  Following 2 years of bullying at school he was obsessive about his appearnace and didn't want to live anymore.  

When he did eventually see the therapist, his life immediately turned around.  Those sessions were exactly what he needed at exactly the right time.

Everyone involved with the CAMHS team, was marvellous.  They understood, were patient and helpful, not only to my son, but also to me.  

It took a year of visits, but in that time my son returned to the out going, fun loving person he had been.  

His depression was so bad he had to be home schooled for a year, but he left with 6 qualifications, which allowed him a place at college.  He now attends full time college and is loving it. 

So for all those carers or parents out there with children: if you believe your child is struggling and may need psyciatric help, I believe you will get excellent help if you are referred to the Nottinghamshire CAMHS team.

It took a year for my son to turn his life around but with the help of CAMHS, it happened.","RHA_711Child and adolescent mental healthRHANG3 6AARHA_711service","Last year","a relative","52866","Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Thank you for your comments, we are pleased to hear the good news about your son.

"577","D.D","I have accessed adult mental health services through a referal from my GP, after an initial assessment where I clearly stated that I felt that medication would be something I thought or would like to explore in order to allow me to continue on my personal ""Recovery"" journey. I was then refered to a team that would not be able to actualy help me with this.

My dealings with the service have been difficult and very stressfull because the service has not been able to to even commincate with me to tell me what is going on. I have been left waiting to hear from them, I was not informed that the waiting list to see someone increased from 3 months to 6 months. The service did not even leave an answer phone message to notify me that they have attempted to contact me. Also notification by post in my case has been nearly non existant as well. 

Unfortunatly despite being given the correct address to contact my GP and to pass on the corrospondance about my treatment they have used my previous GP, mixed in with my current GPs practice. Therefore my current GP has no records of anything I have currently undergone and disscussed with the health and Mind Team.

My GP has not even recieved the correct information from the Adult Mental Health Services Practitoner that I saw earlier this year to try to get a diagnosis. Even after seeing me and agreeing that there is something, they then still only gave a general answear stating that it may possibly be one of two diagnoses and I feel even these ignored most of the disscussion I had during the consultation.

This has recently come to a head with the benefit reforms as when the DWP were gathering evidence, I currently have none so as far as they are concerned there is nothing wrong with me. It has taken a long time for me to come to terms with the fact that I have mental health problems and I have been working towards tackling these issues myself through voluntary work, training and by engaging in personal ""Recovery"".

I feel let down yet again by the people that are supposed to be the ones who are supporting me. I am doing everything I possibly can to try and avoid reaching a crisis point but it feels like I am having to fight the very people that are supposed to understand to actually get them to acknowledge what is going on.

I have had a response from the team:
Our service, Health in Mind/Let's Talk Wellbeing , has been undergoing many change over the last year. As a result of this process and a reduction in the budget for Step 4 services we have lost a number of Clinical Psychology posts and have been operating with a reduced team. In addition, the team has experienced higher levels of sickness during this difficult time which has further reduced our capacity to meet the demand.  
We have been very concerned about the growing number of people waiting on our waiting list and the amount of time they have been waiting for. We have been in talks with our managers in order to address this problem and we have, this week,  been given the go ahead to recruit 1.0wte Clinical Psychologist until March using underspend money. We are also looking at other ways of offering these people a service as quickly as possible, some of whom have been waiting since February. We apologise for that.

I understand that you have now been offered an appointment and I hope that after such a wait you find the service helps you in your recovery. Good luck.

"578","simag8","I was referred by my GP back in October 2010. After a couple of months I had my first initial consultation. From that consultation I was told that I would have to wait to hear from them for my talking therapy sessions to begin. I had opted out of ‘phone therapy’.
Now it’s early September 2011 and I’ve just had my first talking therapy appointment... 11 months on!
From being told to wait to hear from them and getting a letter notifying me of my first session was several months, in that time there was no correspondence from them at all. It would have been nice to have an update or two to keep in me informed.

Yes, I’m finally getting help and very grateful for that, but waiting almost a year? In my opinion this is unacceptable. I’m sure I’m not a lone voice here. In that time I, or others may have been in crisis and the fall-out from that.

Here are direct quotes from Let’s Talk website and leaflet:
“A service to help people with common mental health problems gain quick access to evidence based talking therapy.”
“If you require a face-to-face appointment, it will normally be arranged within 10 working days and within a maximum of 20 working days.”

I feel the wording needs to be revised and the service needs to reflect this. I believe people will respect honesty if they are told how long the potential waiting times are and be kept updated.

Unfortunately,  when the service opened it was asked to offer help to over 1,000 people who were already waiting for help from previous services.  We agreed to offer help and contacted everyone waiting.   In the early months our new service also received  referrals for twice as many people as expected  and we also contacted all of those people to offer help.  Unfortunately,  both of these things meant that everyone had to wait much longer than planned to begin treatment.  

On a more positive note, we have been working extremely hard and have trained  many more  staff. This means that people who are now referred into our service are seen within ten days of contacting us for an appointment and most are likely to  start treatment within days or a few weeks, depending on treatment choice.

I realise that this does not change how long you have waited,   but I do hope it may help  you to understand why this happened and to know that it has improved.  We apologise once again for your wait.

I used to go to a carers group, once a week we went to Skylarks Holme Pierpont. They had a lovely heated swimming pool which had all the facilities for disabled and able people.

Patients have in the past gone swimming with the occupational therapy and physio services that work with us on B50. However, this has usually been facilitated as part of an individualised plan of care for the patient concerned, rather than as a group. 

Patients went to their own local pools to help increase confidence in using their own local facilities. I will raise the issue with the senior occupational therapy and physio staff, as well as our Activity Coordinator, to highlight the interest in the activity and assess if it  is achievable given the reduction in allied health professional services we have experienced this year.

Imagine my delight when I was told by Kirsty my physio that she had been able to organise a swimming session at my local leisure centre following a request I made at a patients meeting a few weeks previously.

The sun rose early to accompany our taxi ride from QMC and we joined the queue of lunchtime swimmers. With eager anticipation which was enhanced by being told that the carers were free!

The bubbles of water, cool on late Summer skin was completely exhilarating, as was our 30 minute swim so that Kirsty and I emerged from the pool invigorated and refreshed.

A few minutes under a warm shower followed by lunch in the cafeteria preceded a session of basking in the sun and breathing in the very fresh air while we waited for our taxi to return. An absolutely valuable experience and a real feeling of normality.

Thank you so much to everyone involved and the greatly appreciated adventure!'

I felt absolutely distraught and lost. I felt like I was dumped there under the impression that there would be people like me on the ward but found this wasn’t the case. I saw women running round with their bras off, half naked men who had urinated and soiled themselves and too many things to talk about. 
If it wasn’t for the brilliant top notch doctor I don’t know how I would have coped. After 1 ½ - 2 weeks I was transferred to B50, what a difference. 
I am greatly disappointed with the treatment I received from Bassetlaw to Bestwood ward – which I feel was totally inappropriate for me at the time, it only seemed to make my mental health state worse. I only hope no-one else has to go through the same.

"597","Tim Wood","In supporting adults in their mental health recovery FOCUS @ Aspley Community and Training Centre has become totally service user managed.  A committee of service users has been set up and is looking at how the FOCUS provision can be developed further.

For me this has been both an exciting time and also one in which I have had to relinquish control.  Although I am still running the courses at Aspley Community and Training Centre, the Committee are now responsible for the development of the provision including finding ways of funding future activities.

The Focus committee are currently working towards becoming a charity so that they can attract funding from different sources.

What I am most proud of is the development of the committee members who are taking on the responsibility that being on a committee represents.  The Chair, Secretary and Treasurer are embracing their role and working to ensure the committee and the services offered are successful.

The Committee will be hosting their first AGM in May 2012

"598","bumblebee","I wish to express my gratitude to the trust for re-involving the excellent services of the CAT Team in my son`s community care. They were heavily involved with his move out of Highbury Hospital to his placement in the community which was specially designed around his particular complex needs. The main aim was to ensure that any hospital re-admissions were kept to a minimum and with the help of the team in the south his personal staff have done an excellent job in keeping him out of hospital for 18 months, which in my opinion is a huge achievement! 

The CAT Team withdrew when they were satisfied that things were going well for him. However, because his health needs have recently fluctuated so much, the team from the north are visiting his home to work with his staff again. Fortunately they are nurses who worked with him when he was in hospital - this will bring some familiarity and continuity into his life.  He has had to make some huge adjustments since leaving hospital and the team and staff are trying to extend his periods of good health so that he can enjoy life more.

"599","Oliver B50","Food quality on B50 and variety is very good, but my only complaint is that the food is thrown away before you have time to finish your food. I am a slow eater but a big eater and I enjoy my food, quite often I would like seconds. I often go back to ask for more and get told ‘its been thrown away’ all I am asking is that we are given a bit more time to finish our food.
As staff have to get away at 6 o’clock I feel rushed. The renal menu is not good, pasta is like glue, often don’t get the right food, very rarely do I get what I asked for, eg I have been given bananas and crisps which are not allowed because of the salt content. I even write this on the menu but had no success.

I’m sorry to hear of the difficulties you’ve experienced around the food and catering service with food being discarded before you’ve had chance for seconds and also being offered foods unsuited to your dietary needs.
As you may have been aware food provision when you were a patient with us was provided by an outside catering company; food is now provided by ‘in house’ catering at the QMC. The impact on catering and food provision seems to be a system that is becoming more responsive to patient needs/tastes.
Certainly the QMC have tried to provide the ward with staff for the evening meal who are contracted to stay until 6.45pm so meals are not so rushed. Also that catering staff do not discard remaining foods until nursing staff have asked if anyone would like ‘seconds’. I’m not saying the new system is perfect, but there seems to be better communication between the ward and catering services and much more willingness to listen to what you, the patient, needs.
Once again I’m sorry to have taken so long to answer your posting, but thank you for providing us with feedback on your experiences; it does help us to make changes to the service we provide.

"616","simag8","I'm a Public Governor Member and recently became an Ambassador for AMH (Adult Mental Health) for Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust (Nottinghamshire County). I attend quarterly Members Council meetings and numerous other events/meetings across the Trust. I feel that this is a great initiative by the Trust to have the public governor members to help shape the services it provides.
 
I'm a volunteer at the Involvement Centre's. Duncan Macmillan House, Nottingham, the Rosewood Centre, New Ollerton, and the Nottingham Recovery Education Centre, Sherwood. I also attend SODA (Self Harm, OCD, Depression, Anxiety) at Mansfield Woodhouse.

It’s great to meet a wide range of service users, carers, volunteers, patients, staff and senior managers from across the Trust, both Local and Forensic, and see first-hand, the services that Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust is providing.

Having lived experienced service user/carer involvement and feedback is vital to how the Trust develops and shapes all its services now and in the future. 

I’m also involved with Patient Opinion and have been part of several workshops. It’s an absolute privilege to talk with people about how they feel about the care and services they are receiving, listen to their stories about Adult Mental Health, changes they would like to see and being honest about times when perhaps they feel that things could have been better.

As a service user myself, diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety over a decade ago, I have had and continue to get, terrific support. So many people are a part of this. Too many to mention here, but a big thanks to Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust for helping me in my recovery, or discovery is a word I heard someone use, I like that better!

Recovery is the ‘buzz’ word for this year but for those of us with a chronic mental health problem managing our condition is the best we can hope for. The IT classes are a vital part of this.
I know from experience that mainstream classes are totally unsuitable for someone like me. What is so important is the continuity of the course in a non-threatening environment for staff and volunteers who understand your problems. The IT classes are the last vestige in my life of the possibility of returning to work one day.

A Recovery Education Centre has been opened on Mansfield Road, Nottingham.

The IT, Basic Skills and drama provision moved out to Aspley Community and Training Centre supported.  Currently members of staff are supporting their service users to manage this provision themselves.  A committee has been created to manage the development of the project (now known as Focus at Aspley Community and Training Centre) as well as the administration of the membership.

The committee are meeting monthly and hope to hold their first AGM in April 2012.  The committee is currently made up of 11 service users and 2 carers. 
 
The committee would like to work with the Trust as a partner.  A delegation from the Focus committee are hoping to meet up with Professor Mike Cooke Notts. Healthcare Trust Chief Executive in the not too distant future.

Since the launch of our booklet, we are looking to work on further aims; however with very few members we are unable to work successfully towards new goals. 

we are looking for people who are: 
- interested in raising awareness of Asperger syndrome 
- work with or live with the condition 
- want to meet some new and interesting people
- willing to meet up regularly and are not afraid of hard work! 
- able to spare some time and effort for a good cause 

you do not need to have a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome to join our community of interest - just a passion and willingness to help others and raise awareness.

we welcome any thoughts and ideas, so please get in touch.

You can join online or attend meetings. 

Opening the Door For Asperger's
The Asperger's Community of Interest has existed since August 2010. It involves a wide range of people interested in raising awareness about Asperger's Syndrome, alongside improving welfare and quality of life for those with the condition.
Together we are working to gather a body of shared experience, including both positive experiences and clinical understanding. We aim to produce presentations and documentation to help the neurotypical community understand Asperger's, and those affected by it. Below are some quotes from group members:
“As a person with Asperger's Syndrome I have frequently felt in groups I was a person on the outside looking through a window into a warm room, but now with the Community of Interest I meet with like-minded people and have come in from the cold.”
“Since being part of the Community of Interest I’ve gained a greater knowledge of my son, who has Asperger's.”
“As an adult with Asperger's Syndrome I feel that my condition leaves me as an eternal outsider.  This group allows me to develop a new perspective about my condition, expressing it in a useful way and at the same time increasing understanding of the non-Aspergers community.”
As a group we are seeking to make contact with anyone who has an interest in Asperger's Syndrome.
You might have the condition, care for someone with it or work with those with it.
We are an inclusive group open to all parts of the community.

"635","patient01 on B50","I think the things that could be improved on this ward are:
A regular time to see the consultant as far as this is possible.
A small space on ward dedicated to private reading or writing, i.e. no loud TV and no visitors.
More showers, i.e. 2 per ward dedicated M/F.
At times I thought the ward appeared to be over-staffed with agency(?) carers who had little to do.

Very friendly & relaxed environment & good access to key workers.

I have to say I am not that impressed with the food. I think it’s low budget with 4 basic options. I feel we could do with more choice and variety.

Being a wheelchair user on the ward is difficult as there is no accessible shower on B2 and I have to go elsewhere or have a bath which is not easy. I can’t reach the alarm due to being in a wheelchair should I fall out of bed or in the toilet. Windows are difficult to open because of my disability.

However, staff are brilliant. I was worried about coming into the ward, I thought it was not for me but they have been so helpful so I could totally relax in the environment and talk to people again. It changed my whole views and opinions.

They make me believe in myself! They see things I don’t see and that is so helpful. Staff don’t pressure you. They have helped me so much in my recovery. I’ve gained a new perspective on staff and psychiatric services. 

Staff on B2 want you to recover. The care is the most important thing

"649","Janzq3"," I would like to tell you about the Childhood & Adolescent Mental Health Service Children Looked After Service (CAMHS CLA) I have recently experienced.

I am a foster carer and have been looking after a little girl for almost 7 months (she has now moved on to a long term foster family). 

The little girl I have looked after is a real shiny star. However, her past prior to having been taken into care, very quickly started to 'show' itself in her behaviour shortly after she started to live with me.

CAMHS CLA been supporting me / us through our time together and have been outstanding on every level.

The advice, guidance and 'tools' that CAMHS has given me to support this little girl have all been fantastic. I would not have believed such a difference could be made to a child's behaviour and trauma, but have witnessed first hand the value of your service on every level.

Something as 'simple' as giving the little girl a dummy and a bottle and regressing her has had a significant impact upon her.

CAMHS have helped me to understand various behaviours which have been presented to me by the little girl. Each session I have had with Camhs , I have left with practical tools and techniques to apply to what at times has felt a dire and desperate situation.

I am incredibly grateful for the service that i /we have received. I have upmost respect for the professional approach that is taken in your service, for the level of knowledge, care and respect which was shared with me, and I will be forever grateful to your service for making such a positive difference to a little girls life.

When the little girl first came to stay with me, I did wonder what her future would hold. It felt so bleak. And yet, when she left 2 weeks ago I now have a very positive feeling that her future will be bright. Without your service, I doubt this would be the case.

Please pass on my thanks to all involved in helping us to access your service.

"651","glad722","In August 2005, one day came in my house: a psychiatric doctor, 2 GPs, a social worker, a care nurse, and outside the house waited for me too a police car with two policemen. Why? Because I was critically ill and I did not know, at that time, how bad I was…
After some talk with them I decided to go hospital to find out what was wrong with me – the psychiatric doctor was pleased because I accepted the suggestion… I packed up some things, such as: a towel, my pyjamas, my toothbrush and toothpaste etc and I went with them to hospital escorted by the police car…
At arrival at Highbury Hospital, Nottingham, the staff welcomed me and they had a friendly and kind reaction to me. Nevertheless, I was very upset, I start to cry with bitterness and I asked the social worker to take me back home… 
Then, the management offered me a private room, words of encouragement and all the support I needed – I calmed down and I settled in the room waiting for each step of investigation, tests and medications. 
Two days later I was diagnosed with a very severe mental disorder – schizophrenia – and I was registered on section 2 of the mental health act 1983, and the process of my healing started.
I was in hospital for seven weeks, then I asked my doctor to let me go home; I was not healed but I wanted to be in my own house instead of in hospital…
At the same time, in July 2005, because of my illness, being in the garden, I had dizziness, I lost my balance and I fell on concrete and I broke my left wrist and tendon - half of my left arm was in plaster and I could not use my hand for my day by day needs for a very long time. 
Back at home it was incredible hard to cope with both situations: my mental illness and my broken wrist and tendon, but the support from my care coordinator and doctors helped me through. 
My journey of recovering was very emotional, full of despair, lack of concentration, hard speech, tiredness, sleepless and nightmares… And then I started to do things again: to read, to write, to speak, to listen, to do the necessary things for my day by day living…
Later on, at some friend’s suggestion, both retired doctors, being under their care and support for eleven weeks, I attended an alpha course in their home – the history of Jesus Christ and it is a remarkable pick point in my journey of recovering. 
My confidence, my spirit and my hopes for better start began to build up slowly, but surely.
Also, an important role on my journey of recovering was my attendance, for over five years, one morning per week, the IT course at SPAN, Foster Drive, Nottingham. The support they have given me up to today is wonderful. During my attendance there I started to write down some manuscripts which reflected my personal, emotional and spiritual life – maybe one day I will be able to publish them for other ill people’s benefit and to encourage them on their journey of recovering too. I believe it could make a difference to them. 
Myself… I am not completely healed – healing is a long way to go and it takes time – but with my determination, with God’s help and the care and understanding from everybody, I believe, I will overcome it.
The care I received was wonderful and life-changing. Receiving care made me feel grateful and blessed.

I’d like to take this opportunity and to say a big “Thank you”, for the care and support during my hard time, to:

The Psychiatric consultant, inpatient of Highbury Hospital, Nottingham – and the team
The Psychiatric consultant, outpatient of Gedling Community for Mental Health, Nottingham
Care co-ordinator of Gedling Community for Mental Health, Nottingham

"654","emo788","If you had told me in September that the next 6 months of my life were going to be like, I would have laughed (or screamed) in your face.

My story began on in mid October 2010 when I was admitted to ‘B2’, Bassetlaw Hospital’s Acute Psychiatric Ward.  I was sitting in a room without windows and looking at the strange hippy like posters on the wall.  I was listening to ‘K’, one of the nurses; she was talking to me and asking me a lot of questions.  I wasn’t talking much; I was frightened and very confused.  I remember asking about the posters of chackras. ‘K’ said that they belonged to ‘P’ and she would ask her to talk to me about them.

Later in the week I was approached by a woman with a shock of spiky blonde hair and not dressed in the ward uniforms I was accustomed to. ‘P’ introduced herself to me and we went to talk about the therapies that she offered.  Before I go any further, I should point out that at this point in my life I was a’ dyed in the wool’ alternative therapy sceptic.  I was very much of the opinion that Indian Head massage was for ‘for ladies that do lunch’ with too much time and money on their hands. ‘P’ suggested that I should put my head in the lion’s mouth “I know” said ‘P’ “It’s a terrible title for a really good therapy, perhaps we could make up a better name for it”.

So I was primed and ready for my first session of ‘Emo Trance’, what on earth had I let myself in for?  I sat on the soft pale blue therapy chair and ‘P’ began.  This first session was one of the hardest things I have ever done.  I could physically feel the emotional pain in my left shoulder.  With ‘P’s guidance I was able to soften the pain and move it from my body.  At the end of this session, I was physically and mentally drained.  I slept deeply for several hours (something I have not done for weeks).

 I worked through the therapy over the next week or so.  Towards the end of the second week I realised that I was sleeping through the nights without additional medication. ‘P’ had given me some books and I read them avidly.  I could feel that I was getting better, I read about Emotional Freedom Techniques.  I then used tapping to help me especially with my anxiety.

So why did I suddenly start not only believing in, but using alternative therapies?  Well for me, I understood that acupuncture was accepted as a remedy that worked for all ailments, both physical and mental.  Both the therapies I was using were based on the meridians that were used in acupuncture.  I also really felt that I was being empowered to harness the power of my brain to heal myself. In addition to the therapies the ward also had sessions in Tai Chi.  I really enjoyed these.  The instructor talked about the spiritual side of Tai Chi, this resonated with me.  I feel that my journey from the ward to recovery has been a spiritual one.

I have now been out of the ward for over 10 weeks.  I am going back to my work as a Head of Department in a large secondary school.  I feel that I have not only made a speedy recovery, but I am equipped with the tools that I need to listen to what my mind and body are saying to me.  I have stayed motivated, I use the gym every day, I have also made several visits to work and have also been actively involved in DIY jobs in my new house.

I am utterly convinced that I will make a full recovery and will be drug free.

"655","mh44","I am in my 30's, male with 2 young children.  Several years ago I was admitted onto Ward B2 after suffering with depression for a long period of time.  I had been on a course of anti-depressants and along with regular visit to my GP had been seeing therapists and psychiatrists.  Although these treatments were good in the short term, my problems and difficulties with dealing with certain situations soon resurfaced.  This got to the point where I attempted suicide and was unable to guarantee my own safety.

During my second period on B2, I was approached by ‘R’ and asked if I would be interested in trying some alternative therapies as she thought they would be beneficial to me.  After several weeks and numerous sessions, I was released from hospital but kept returning on a weekly basis to attend appointments with ’R’.

My last appointment was over a year ago and although I still suffer with difficulties in coping and at times struggle, I have not attempted to harm myself.  I strongly believe it is because of the work with ‘R’ and the other staff on B2 that I am not just coping but leading a normal life.  I have been working now for over 8 months, looking after my 2 young children and carrying out normal everyday tasks,  things that up until 12 months ago and before the amazing work of all the staff on and connected to the Mental Health Unit, I found almost impossible.

Thank you so much.  I owe my life to you guys.

2009 looked into Mandala centre decided it was not for me. saw a dr. at my surgery who jumped up from his desk stepped back from me said there is nothing for me here and that I  have a personality disorder. I was told to go home and get to know myself. I asked if I would have to go back t my home town to get any support.He implied that by doing this I would be using the system and as I left the surgery he said ""good luck"". I had asked another dr. for help  and that suggested I would have to find my own psychiatrist expect to wait 12mnths, i didn’t know where to look. 

They didn’t listen I’m on my own struggling, scared sometimes, I must be beyond help otherwise they would help me?

"658","Janzq3","Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust involves service users, carers, members and governors in the monthly Induction programme for new staff members. 
Involvement is at the heart of the organisation. It is one of the most important messages to communicate to new staff coming into the organisation. 
Service users and carers say how much they enjoy presenting to new staff and telling their story. 
'I want new staff to understand what it's like for me to have a Mental Health issue and a learning disability. I care for my brother who has autism and depression and I cared for my Mum when she was depressed too. I have a learning disability and I've got insight that I want to share, we are just like you and want you, (new staff) to understand this’.

‘If it wasn’t for involvement I would have nothing in my life. It’s important to be listened to and not to be rushed and I hope staff can learn from my experience.’

Service users know how they want to be treated and to be given the chance to educate staff’’.

One of our governor members shared his thoughts and asked new staff at Induction a question.

‘If a family member took ill, would you refer your loved ones to the services you work for?
 If you are receiving services for the first time you rely on what you are given and the knowledge and experience of staff to do the right thing. As staff what would you do to improve services?  Trust staff are in a position to help and do something about it.

A carer shares her views
‘The good thing about taking part in staff induction is that I can share my passion for involvement with others. ‘Involvement gives you something more to live for and when staff are understanding it helps that we get the right support and reduces stigma. Anyone can be in our position’.

From the smile of the member of staff to the diabetic custard, I was part of the Peat Audit* and have not been on the wards for a number of years. A big improvement was the serving area. Different for each ward, with menus displayed in an appropriate area. Patients are much happier when they do not have to complain about the food.

*PEAT is an annual assessment of inpatient healthcare sites in England that have more than 10 beds. 
  
It is a benchmarking tool to ensure improvements are made in the non-clinical aspects of patient care including environment, food, privacy and dignity.  
 
The assessment results help to highlight areas for improvement and share best practice across healthcare organisations in England.

"665","finmental","I am very concerned at the proposed closure of SPAN, foster drive, nottingham. In my opinion, the decision making process should take into account that short term financial gain (the sale of a site) is going to have long term financial consequences for the NHS when desperate service users inevitably fetch up at GPs and casualty and require more one to one psychiatric support and in patient care.
It is all very well saying services will continue in alternative sites.  Where are these buildings?  Do they have disabled access? Do they have the facilities to continue the high level of facilities, care and support that we get in SPAN. What support is being give to staff who are faced with finding alternate venues?  Surely the Trust should have found these alternative venues before the announcement was made to service users that their lifeline was being sold off?  
It feels to me like no one in higher management understands the detrimental effect all this uncertainty causes to many with mental health problems, not to mention that I feel the trust is putting money before patients.  
SPAN used to be a vibrant, well used facility with a whole range of therapeutic activities. But gradually it has been run down, many of the groups simply disappearing. SPAN is a wonderful modern building with good facilities and potential to offer a wide range of activities that could be opened up to the public to create a community hub, offering that favourite buzz words ""social inclusion"". The alternative is moving groups into ""the community"" where we rarely see a member of the public. It doesn't feel like this is inclusive to me?
Finally, why can't we have a bit of joined up government ?  I go to three different groups.  The Trust wants to get rid of SPAN, the council day centre i attend is under threat and i also get support from Famework, who have had their budget slashed by the council.  These are all things that keep me functioning.  What hope do i have if all these facilities close?","RHA_710Adult mental healthRHANG3 6AARHA_710service","Today","a service user","44413","Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Dear Finmental

Whilst I am not in a position to answer directly for the Trust I do understand how difficult things are at the moment and if you are a service user that I work with I would be more than happy to offer you or ensure you get extra support from one of my colleagues.

There does seem to be a great deal of uncertainty at the moment, this would appear to be the result of current funding issues and of course the new directions in which the Trust feels it must go to ensure that services are up-to-date and meet service user need (now and in the future) as well as governmental directives.  

Change is notoriously difficult, but I am hopeful that the services that I am involved in will continue in the community. I am sure if you have any questions about the services offered at SPAN Julie (my manager) would be happy to discuss these with you. As people that struggle with their mental health we do find change far more difficult as it would appear to undermine our mental state; however I believe that in supporting each other we can work together and create a similar environment to that which SPAN offers, who know maybe even better.  

I can now confirm that; following confirmation of funding availability for the next year, the service user committee (that was setup by me to look at where we move the Admin, IT and Basic Skills to) have voted unanimously to move to Aspley Community and Training Centre on Minver Crescent in Aspley. The committee all agreed that the facilities at Aspley were ideal and would meet service user need. (For more information about the centre please visit <a href=""www.aspleyctc.co.uk"">www.aspleyctc.co.uk</a>)The move is scheduled to take place on Friday 25th February and courses will resume on Tuesday 1st of March at Aspley Community and Training Centre. Of course if you attend any of these groups and would like extra support to access the centre I will endeavour to accommodate any such requests.

Over the next week anyone that currently attends the Admin, IT and or Literacy and Numeracy will be receiving a letter with more information about the move to Aspley Community Centre.

There is also the creation of a Recovery Education Centre which is currently under development. The Recovery Education Centre will hopefully enable access to lots of different opportunities and support in service user’s individual recovery needs.

I am hopeful that we can work together to create services that continue to offer support to those who we already work with as well as those new to our services.  I would hope to be able to support you through this difficult time and welcome the opportunity of working with you to create opportunities that meet the needs current and future users of our services.

I hope this help to make you feel a little bit better about the changes that are taking place – please do not hesitate in contacting me should you require further support.

In my opinion this shows little understanding of mental health. You have been, as always, wonderfully supportive and understanding. The thought of moving venues is exceedingly anxiety-provoking but as the Trust has already moved my creative groups from span to Broad street,to stonebridge and back to span in recent years, I suppose I should be used to it now!

Over the past few years the service provided to carers has improved considerably. Carers are recognised as an integral part of the service users recovery and as such have their own support needs. On admission to the ward the carer is provided with a Carer’s Booklet which has been developed through partnership working with the Involvement Centre at Ollerton. Carer’s were involved in the development and provided support with its launch on the ward via informal talks to the staff on what it is like to be a carer. Within the booklet is a chapter on the rights of carers to have an assessment of their needs and nursing staff ensure all carers are offered this. 

The ward has a Carer Link worker who ensures the Carer Notice Board (situated just outside the ward) is maintained with up to date literature and notices. The Carer Link also has a greater knowledge of the services available to carers and can signpost to these E.g. the monthly carers group held on the unit. The carer link is responsible for maintaining the carer library which contains a number of books available to loan on various mental health problems and on being a carer. As the carer link cannot be available on every shift a member of staff is identified to be the carer link and this is written on the ward board at the entrance to the ward.

In March 2010 at the wards annual development day the morning session consisted of a benchmarking exercise to rate the service we provide to carers. This session was co –facilitated by a carer who has had a loved one on the ward. Other developments on the ward have also been supported by service users and carers. Representatives form the ward frequently attend the Involvement Centre to provide updates. 

During the admission of a loved one, liaison with carers takes a high priority and carers are routinely invited to the ward round. If the carer is unable to attend, information is requested from the carer which is written in a specific ‘carer feedback’ box on the ward round information form.

Please feel free to contact me for any further information.

"669","poshtart1313","I agree with what 'PIXIE' has to say concerning the closure of SPAN.  I too am concerned about what is going to happen to all the people who attend the classes. What price health? What is happening to this country? Soon there will be no need for places like SPAN as we will all have ended it.

We are at the moment all very happy with the service provided at SPAN.  It is a place where we all feel comfortable, safe and relaxed now all this has changed.  Since the meeting, held at SPAN, life has been chaos for most of us.  Where there was once peace and calm there is now uncertainty and unrest none of feel safe anymore.

Tim is trying to find us somewhere else to set up the IT groups and therefore continue the support but then how long will it be before we are to be told 'we can no longer finance this scheme'.  How long will this treatment of us last, we didnt ask to have this happen to us so why make it worse by withdrawing facilities?

We need the support and company of others who are in the same position as ourselves, most of us cannot cope in the 'normal world' we lack the confidence. We need places like SPAN and by closing them down it is not saving money as we then need further support from doctors, hospitals, psychiatrists and the like.

Thank goodness for Tim he is brilliant, at least he is supporting us and treating us how we want to be treated.

"670","Pixie","I am most concerned about the imminent closure of the Span Centre, Foster Drive, Nottingham.   The staff there do a good job in supporting the service users and enabling them to lead a useful and productive life.  I fear that this support will be seriously diluted, or even lost when the centre closes this year.  Even if the staff are still employed by the Trust, and based at Highbury Hospital (I understand), without a base to meet at the essential contact will be lost.  Therefore this is a very worrying time for the service users.  
The building itself is modern and well suited to its purpose. and it should be more fully utilised rather than closed.  
Support and activities in the community are all very well in theory, but in practice it often means vulnerable people getting lost in the system, amongst the crowd, because this contact is severed. Lack of support can lead to deterioration in mental health, and anguish for the patient as well as more work for the hard-pressed mental health services.","RHA_710Adult mental healthRHANG3 6AARHA_710service","Today","a service user","44113","Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Thank you for your posting.

Adult Mental Health Nottingham City is faced, as are all public sector organisations, with the challenge of providing services with greatly reduced income.  One strategy that has informed our cost improvement programme has been to close buildings rather than reduce staffing as this has less impact on service users.  Some centres have closed but the community groups formerly running from this centre all continue in community locations.

The Wellbeing and Social Inclusion Service based at the SPAN building on Foster Drive supports approximately 750 service users but only about 50 attend the building.  Alternative locations are actively being sought for the groups that are currently held in the SPAN building. We are committed to supporting people as well as we can.

I hope this information helps you to see the challenging environment in which we try and provide the best services we can.

At present there are not any easy answers to the current situation as we are unclear what monies are going to be available to run and develop our services.

I have been given a budget for moving the IT, Literacy and Numeracy classes into the community I am hopeful that I will have a solution for this move by the end of January 2011 and will be working with service users in making the decision where we move to.  

I am also keen to continue the levels of support I currently offer to people that have moved on to employment or education outside of SPAN and would hope to be in a position as to know whether I am able to carry this on and how this will work once I have the above classes settled in to their new premises.

I know the Trust is committed to improving services; however there are of course the normal worries that we all have as regards our coping with transition and change.  I am hopeful that our team will be in a position to be able to continue to support you in the future. I would very much hope we would avoid “vulnerable people getting lost in the system”

"673","Rambuie","Biographical and career notes
An uneventful boy-hood and some Academic achievements saw me through tertiary education, which I completed in the early seventies.  The occurrence of diagnosable symptoms appeared in what came to be my final year, but my course work merited the award of a BA Honours in Combined Humanities (aegrotat) 
I was 21 years old.  

The slur cast by the nature of my diagnosis, I felt, ensured that there were no opportunities to sit for any professional qualifications, so my vocation of Librarian remained on hold to this day.  Five years passed without Library employment in any capacity, five years punctuated with a break-down, four months’ hospitalisation and continuing treatment for schizophrenia, until Employment resettlement pointed me in the direction of a Library Supplier sweat-shop in Nottingham, where I remained full-time for fifteen years.  At no stage did the financial rewards for this engagement creep up above my entitlements as a disabled person!  

I have never considered myself to be a drudge, so after being pushed about by ‘thatcherite insurgents’ in the 1990s, I agreed with the firm’s doctor that I had had a run for my money and it was time to abandon ship.  

My Liberation was palpable and it is something I can never regret.  Creativity had returned after a dormancy of some 21 years.  I returned to writing and belatedly, to an interest I had shared with my Father in my teen-age years, Photography.  

Progressive thinking from Nottingham Healthcare has ensured my survival and provided occupational fulfilment via continuing care arrangements which have sustained me thus far.  For many, schizophrenia is a life-sentence but the redeeming quality of any predicament is that some good can come out of it .  I am indebted to the many well-wishers and the encouragement I have received from employees of the Nottinghamshire Healthcare Trust, firstly for convincing me I have a present and a future and for now, for investing in that future.   

","RHA_710Adult mental healthRHANG3 6AARHA_710service","Unknown","the patient","43592","Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Thank you for taking the time to share your story of hope. 

The Trust is committed to reducing the stigma people experience through their diagnosis. It is heartening to hear that you recognise our organisation has played a part in your survival.

Your positive outlook in turning your life around will bring hope and inspiration to others facing similar predicaments.

I would like to wish you every success in your future.

43703Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust RHA435922011-01-04T10:25:48.613poRambuieRambuieThe us and you in this response places an uncomfortable distance which the responder may or may not have intended, but to me it seems to enforce a client-based connection and detachment which betrays a measure of disinterest in out-comes: If you really would like to wish me every success, then why not play a full part in helping to bring that about?

On this uncertainty hangs a reservation.  The trust and its progressive thinking once had a fully participatory approach, and it is the approach of the Skills and Practical Activities Network which enjoys my full gratitude and appreciation for its contribution to my survival.  From what I understand, the Trust is as of now busy dismantling what I believe is its flag-ship enterprise, SPAN, and at this juncture it would be entirely appropriate to provide the people who have passed through, or are current members, adequate explanation as to how it is so suddenly out of favour? It feels to me that there is pressure being piled on for disadvantaged people incapacitated by difficulties with mental ill-health to suddenly transmogrify into model fodder for the employment market - to gratify a target dreamed up at Westminster, which in my opinion is set to dissolve a burgeoning number of incurably ill claimants which might make embarrassing reading. 

If I might venture an opinion on this, I feel that if some realism had prevailed, it would be more widely recognized that in 36 years, clients' needs have not changed from a need to be meaningfully occupied - which is very different from being thrown onto an employment market which I believe would have us sweep leaves in autumn, snow in winter, blossom in Spring and sweating tar in Summer - rather than cost the Exchequer any money.  Yes, the Health of the Nation does cost money, but in my opinion it would cost less if services remained in place to engage people like us appropriately and in accordance with our capacity as citizens.    43992435922011-01-11T23:09:12.397poJulie Grant, Head of Communications, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustJulie Grant, Head of Communications, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustYou obviously feel very strongly about this issue so I would advise you to speak to a member of staff.

"674","M E M P H A S I S","Disabled people in continuing care are facing a new and worrying situation.  It has long been the situation that disadvantage has been recognized and remediated by providing community care, which safeguards against relapse and a worsening situation for which statutory bodies like social services and Healthcare incur a multiplication of costs if they do not implement preventive intervention and provide a social base for vulnerable people to focus and rebuild their lives.  

In my opinion, for mental health the last few years have seen these bases for social and specialist support falling like a house of cards.  In our area, first the Resource at Duncan Macmillan House changed its independent basis for clients and carers to being reclaimed by the Healthcare Trust to serve the trust’s interests (I think) as an Involvement centre.  Next went Manor Road Day Centre for older people, not replaced, and its clients moved in the direction of the Broad Street Centre, which in turn closed a year ago last March, with no efforts as far as I'm aware being made to relocate a vulnerable clientele and all the specialist infrastructure that SPAN had built up with many years’ experience of working with our needs.  I feel the Healthcare Trust needs to Protect its Investment, instead of sweeping it all away, which I feel sets in motion a slide in care standards and a proliferation of costs which have to be met later.  

These personal and social costs show in rates of relapse - the old ‘revolving door’ - and social problems which are left unmet and unmeasured except in high profile catastrophies like suicides and violations of the Law.  

I feel we now have an underclass of ignored people which is very damaging to social cohesion and devastating for the people so ignored.  Where the situation is changing I feel it is in being not simply ignored but in being actively targeted with inappropriate expectations that the disabled  ‘must work’, that Day Care should produce outcomes that move people on - when these people are there with incurable illnesses and recognized vulnerabilities when working functionality is an unrealistic expectation.  

The protection of these people is safeguarded by Statute.  The extent to which the catalogue of pre-meditated closures described here is in violation of statute is contended here to highlight what some people are hoping will not come to light, but I believe this is something which is reaching scandalous proportions.  

As the futures of Beeston Day Centre and the Jewel in the crown of community provision - SPAN Foster Drive currently lie in the balance, the conclusion here is that statutory commitments to continuing care in the community are jettisoned each time a day care facility is swept away.  

These outcomes unfortunately serve to hit the most vulnerable people the hardest!  Withdrawal of the investment in specialist provision that these have afforded I feel recklessly throws a proliferating social and financial cost into an indeterminate future, with maximum distress and hardship for the blameless targeted people who deserve better than to be mal-treated in this way.

We are very proud of how we involve people at the Trust and of the Involvement Centre at Duncan Macmillan House. We have set the centre up on the basis of what service users told us they wanted. We developed the centre and run it in partnership with service users and carers. 

We now have more people connected with the centre than ever and get very positive feedback from service users about our approach and what the centre means to them. In fact, the Involvement Centre was so successful that we opened a second centre in the North of Nottinghamshire. 

Through both centres we ensure that people are informed about developments in the Trust and have opportunities to be involved in a wide range of activities to shape the culture of the Trust and the services we provide. 

We are also committed to providing opportunities through involvement so that people can develop their skills, knowledge and experience and progress in their recovery. 

In response to your wider views: Adult Mental Health Nottingham City is faced, as are all public sector organisations, with the challenge of providing services with greatly reduced income.  One strategy that has informed our cost improvement programme has been to close buildings rather than reduce staffing as this has less impact on service users.  The Broad Street Centre did close but the community groups formerly running from this centre all continue in community locations.

The Wellbeing and Social Inclusion Service based at the SPAN building on Foster Drive supports approximately 750 service users but less than 100 attend the building.  Alternative locations are actively being sought for the groups that are currently held in the SPAN building.

"675","chrisl","I have been attending a Day-Care Centre in the south-west of Nottinghamshire for about six months.  My fellow patients(?) are of mixed ability, ranging from some dementia to very little.

It was with some misgivings that I joined in with the groups.  However, once I settled, about 2-3 weeks, I felt more settled and much less nervous of my ability.  I became quite adept at the tasks set, and more recently have been of assistance to the carers in the organising of particular tasks,eg bingo calling, quizzes and the like.  

My particular ""grouse"", if it may be called that, is the questions of the quizzes have started to be repetitive, and although not recognised by most participants, I find that I am ""switching off"" rather than joining in.
Could I make a plea for more questions, or more ""brain material"".

I also find that the activities are not really planned, I suspect because there can be over twenty people of differing abilities requiring attention.  Staffing?  Planning?  Timings?

I realise that even a Masters Degree is as nothing when one starts to forget chemical formulae that have been inbred for many, many years.  So I can accept that quizzes and the like have to be aimed down the middle.  I accept that the carers are doing their best with the tools at their disposal, but I feel that with a little extra planning it could be so much better.

The carers deserve every credit and I admire their patience in very trying circumstances.

We also provide smoking aids in the form of patches inhalers and lozenges prescribed by our medics.  

With regards to smoking on leaves escorting staff are still in their place of work whilst escorting and should not be exposed to smoke whilst carrying out their job.

"684","bumblebee","I feel the need to highlight the gap, which I am experiencing between Adult Mental Health Services and MHSOP in Notts. Healthcare Trust. With the onset of depression/anxiety in my spouse, we suddenly found ourselves in the elderly directorate which is very daunting for active people in their mid 60’s.

 

I have been struggling for 2 years now and I am sharing this opinion as the service needs to be much more accessible for people who do not show the obvious signs of dementia but become depressed, withdrawn, isolated and fearful because their self-confidence has suddenly been taken away by the diagnosis. 

 

`A` spent over 3 months on an elderly ward at the St Francis Unit; I felt I was not involved sufficiently with the discharge process and unprepared for our future. The situation we now find ourselves in is extremely upsetting and isolating.  I feel it particularly as we have no direct family support and `A` rejects contact with anyone but myself, unless absolutely necessary. 

 

Although we have been treated with respect since the onset of `A`s illness during the time spent in hospital and in the out-patient service, I feel that extra support/advice is required when people enter this stage in their lives – it is traumatising! After all, this is for life, with a gradual decline in the person`s condition and no hope of any real recovery. Roles and relationships suddenly change and this so very difficult for the person left caring. John Suchet mentions the invaluable support he received as his wife`s carer from Admiral Nurses – there aren`t any in Nottinghamshire, as he pointed out himself when he gave a presentation in the county. This sort of service should immediately be put into place when senior citizens face the onset of on-going mental illness in a partner.

 

There is an absolute need for partnership in the services to ensure people obtain the help they require at this time in their lives, particularly when the carer becomes isolated by the very nature of the person`s illness. I feel alone with this situation because `A` is reluctant to engage with anyone - but what about me? The service should seek the best way of ensuring both the person and carer are thoroughly prepared to face the home environment after a stay in hospital.

 

We are the younger generation of senior citizens and these points need addressing! With people living longer now, more research is urgently required to ensure that the problems which mental illness bring at this stage of life are addressed and managed appropriately. Without appropriate support it is so easy for sole carers to become demoralised, depressed and unwell themselves.

 

I would like to know if these comments will be taken on board by the Trust.

"686","La-reve","I was reffered to team in 2009 during a hospital admission and psychotic episode and a time of great vulnerability for me.  I was told it was an intensive service that would provide me with all round support, and offer me a lot more than a standard CMHT and would provide support for 3 years. 

Good in  theory, stability I needed. However, this never materialised all I ever got from team was promises for support, therapy, recovery plans which never materialised. I felt in constant fear of being sectioned or assessed which did not lead to therapeutic relationship. My confidentiality was breached when members of my family were told details of discussion I had with my care co-ordinator without my consent. After this happened numerous times, I raised issue with C.co who then made the decision to not work with me. 

I was left for period without any care co.ordinator. which I felt lead to relapse and two Mental health Act assesments. I was given new C.co who didn't seem to want to listen to me and then left after 3 months. I was told at that stage I was to be sent back to my original CMHT.  this at time of big change for me nearly leading to hospital admission. I had stand in c.co for 2 weeks. 

What happened to the 3 years of intensive support and help. In my opinion, I got 16 months of inconsistency, the last 5 months were hell for me.  Having now had 4 care co-ordinators in that 5 months

Worse still I have requested 11 times to date reasons for transfer back. After 16 months, no explanation. Every time I complain the team seem to suggest it is a symptom of my illness or of disorders I don't believe I have.

I feel very let down and very sad that they have treated me in this way when vulnerable.","RHA_10003Early interventionRHANG3 6AARHA_10003service","Today","the patient","41108","Julie Grant, Head of Communications, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustJulie Grant, Head of Communications, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustThank you for posting your comments.

"687","Just308","I have been in several NHS hospitals, including Bushey Fields Dudley. Wallsgrave Coventry, Rampton Nottinghamshire, Arnold Lodge Leicestershire. In my opinion and all the hospitals I have been in have had staff that haven't got a clue what the word care means.

It felt for me as if staff were not bothered about how you are when you are feeling suicidal and having thoughts of harming yourself, all you get is a shrug of the shoulders or an I really couldn't care less sort of comment. All you need is a little comforting or reassurance and a friendly face that really seems bothered in your care and recovery.

It did also feel to me that if staff think they can get away with something, then they will do it like  sarcastic or derogatory remarks aimed at you or winding you up and trying to get you to be violent so they can lock you up in seclusions.
 

I also feel that patients are not cared for physically like they should be. For example patients who have just had operations are expected to walk from their rooms to the meds trolley each time meds are called.
Some of them fall over with old age but nobody is allowed to help them up and this scenario is repeated over and over but still, nothing is done.
 

This is my experience of Mental Health Hospitals and in my opinion the effectiveness of treatment could be a million times better if the staff had the right attitude to do the job.

During the 1970s I was hospitalised on three occasions for several months each time, finally being discharged in the spring of 1982. Following my discharge (after becoming institutionalised) as an in-patient as it was then known as Mapperley Hospital I received no follow-up whatsoever.
Living alone in the ‘real’ world I felt very vulnerable and I didn’t ever go out except to work and shop for food. Recently, in May this year (30/40 years later) I stumbled ‘by accident’ across the ‘Involvement Centre’ at ‘Duncan Macmillan House’. Since then and attending regularly I have never looked back. Everyone there, the staff, service users, carers and volunteers are all so positive, warm and caring as well as fun loving and I find this so therapeutic.

Thank you for raising your concerns and I’m sorry to hear that this has been your experience.  It is our aim for individuals to be central to, and actively involved in, the planning and preparation for their future.  The service as a whole recognises the huge importance of work and training and there is a dedicated workskills pathway offered by the Therapy Services Department which provides opportunities to gradually support individuals back into work and training.
 
The pathway offers:
 
Unit based projects:
•         Creative Minds
•         Charity Group
•         Horticulture
 
Unit based work placements: 
•         Maintenance Group
•         Patient’s shop – Assistant / Storeroom Assistant & Cleaning Operative
•         Digital Photography
•         Library Assistant
•         Horticulture - allotment
•         Beauty Assistant
•         Sports Assistant
 
Community Placements:
•         College – Leicester College / REMIT
•         Charity Shop Voluntary Placements – MIND / SCOPE
•         Salvation Army – catering voluntary placement
•         Chris’s Auto’s – garage voluntary placement
•         Allotment – horticulture placement
•         RSPCA – voluntary placement.
 
We aim for the pathway to be as varied as possible to provide a wide range of experiences and opportunities to meet the diverse needs and preferences which individuals have.  Not only does it provide the opportunity to develop specific skills, it also allows you to develop areas which you highlight as having being problematic for you in the past such as communication, working alongside others and adapting to different environments.  Wherever possible, we try and match placements in the unit and community to the interests, skills and goals you have and we will support you through the process of disclosure and whilst you are on placement.
 
As you quite rightly point out there are at times restrictions and limitations due to the nature of Arnold Lodge as a secure unit.  However we welcome any suggestions for improvements and are continually evaluating and developing what we offer following patient and staff feedback.
 
If you meet with your Occupational Therapy Keyworker they will be able to discuss options and opportunities available to you both within the unit and the community.  Good luck for your future progress.

Considering I had to visit a NHS hospital and all the talk over the years of removing the stigma attached to mental health I don’t see what has changed, as my latest experience has left a very bad taste in my mouth to put it mildly.

I have had psychiatric care for 37 years but just can’t grasp the idea that when I go to a hospital that are supposed to be addressing my physical concerns they appear to find great pleasure in either totally ignoring me and directing all questions towards the person who has accompanied me to my appointment or they ask a range of questions as to where I live and why I am there when in essence this has no relevance to the presiding situation. 
Is it no wonder that after a while those of us that suffer from a mental illness feel that this is the only area of interest in our lives to anyone outside of the service.
 I don’t see how this should take precedence over the main reason of my visit to the hospital, the treating of my physical state was to be addressed and not my mental illness, I have a psychiatrist for that. I wondered if they could actually see me sitting in the chair.

It is due to this that some of us tend to dwell negativity on the impact of our illness and then find we are set back in our lives due to the knock on effect of not being spoken to in the right manner or not at all.

It begs the question how would some of these “professionals” feel if going to a hospital with a physical problem and being asked a barrage of questions that has nothing to do with their problem.
 What happened to patient confidentiality when trying to address a physical matter that has you worried. It’s high time these so called “professionals” remove the label and see the person, as we’re not just a patient we are people with feelings.

I feel it is the time that this treatment towards people with mental health problems should be long gone and that we educate a wider spectrum of people including “the professionals” to start treating us as they would like to be treated, where’s our equal rights and opportunities that gets so much mention but doesn’t actually happen in practice.

This has led me to have to put in complaints to the NHS in relation to the way I’ve been treated with a hope that I may be able to spare another service user the embarrassment of having to either be ignored or as I stated being asked questions that has nothing to do with the reason for attending hospital appointments that has no bearing on your mental health or not until they (the professionals) have exhausted your integrity and make you feel a lesser person than when you arrived at their office.
I continue to read various extracts about removing stigma from mental health patients and organisations that are campaigning for the right for this to happen. I continue to hope, but these experiences that keep occurring are all too real for me, leaving me tired and fearful of the professionals out there that continue to have no idea.
 They need to have mandatory awareness training in how to deal with people with mental health illnesses and maybe there will be hope for myself and many others.

"694","12w4r","I want to tell you my story, giving you my thoughts and feelings of a journey that has taken me through many passages of services. It all started in an ordinary psychiatric hospital in 1972 where it was old school, everything was hush hush, and my family treated me like some sort of leper and couldn’t understand why I had been sectioned in hospital. Whilst there I had ECT which was barbaric you just went through the prongs and that was that, no support, no advice nothing just the treatment and then you were left to try and work out what was happening and why, I tried to explain things to my family but they just saw me in a different light as though I had two heads.

I had been sectioned and I was aware that 3 people had been involved in this process but again with no real information to go on just the bad feeling of how they made me feel and treated me, the stigma was and still is bad.
 I was made to feel like an outcast and again not knowing the reasons just left on a ward with a lot of people who to me seemed very unwell I couldn’t understand why I was there and not in the comfort of my own home.
 I tried to do all the right things so that I could get out of there, but I was continually made to feel as though what I had to say was not of importance and didn’t matter. Why was this happening to me? Who had the answers? This was as frightening for me as everyone else, but no one saw this they just made me feel worse.

Following this episode of my life I was then introduced to Forensic Services and transferred to Raeside in the early eighties. It was like a closed shop. My family were too frightened to come and see me as they thought the other patients were too violent and wanted to know what crimes they had committed, even though they may not have committed any crimes, they were clearly unwell like me, why could they not see this, did we all need to be wearing a plaster stating this. It was becoming more and more obvious that the stigma attached to my illness was very much in my face and no one cared no one. 

Whilst in Raeside I had to go to the local hospital for out patient’s appointments and again I was made to feel as though I wasn’t of importance as the nursing staff only wanted to know why I was at Raeside, asking my escorts and not even me, was I now invisible as well. I remained at Raeside for eighteen months all the while things staying the same. Following this I moved to Ashworth and Rampton this was another episode of my life of more stigmas, no one wanting to explain things to me, leaving me to feel alone, afraid and wishing this was not happening to me.

Fighting the stigma of mental health and learning disability
A range of postcards featuring local people with personal experience of mental health and learning disability issues has been launched by Nottinghamshire Healthcare as part of its ongoing anti-stigma campaign.

The postcards feature individuals who have used the Trust’s mental health, learning disability and substance misuse services and carers who have experienced discrimination themselves and witnessed it aimed at those they care for.  Combining eye-catching images and frank quotes, it is hoped that the postcards will provoke thought and discussion about the ignorance and fear that surrounds many of the conditions which commonly affect people, but still remain a taboo subject.

Holly is 18 and has bi-polar disorder.  She said:  “Sadness is an emotion that everyone feels.  If I’m sad, it doesn’t mean that it’s just because I’m bipolar.  I still have normal emotions.”

35 year old Adrian has mild Down’s Syndrome and has been bullied his whole life:  “People have always called me names.  I used to get called ‘mongol’, ‘Frankenstein’ and ‘retard’ by my next door neighbour.  That doesn’t feel good.”

The postcards also feature people talking about their experience of schizophrenia, dementia and self-harm.  

The individuals featured and their quotes were brought together by service user Noel Oxford whose work on the campaign is part of his own ongoing recovery process.

Professor Clair Chilvers, Trust Chair said:  “I think these postcards are absolutely stunning.  I find them all very striking and emotive and hope that they will encourage people to think about how they view people with mental health and learning disability issues and ultimately how they treat them.  

“Mental illness can happen to anyone at any time; in fact 1 in 4 will experience it in their lifetime and sadly many of those will also be affected by stigma and discrimination.  I hope that through this campaign we can raise awareness and understanding and encourage people to talk openly about mental health issues.”       

The postcards will be widely available across the Trust and at many public events including Nottinghamshire Healthcare’s Annual General Meeting in September.

"695","h4703","I feel as though we have had all our stress relievers taken away from us. What I mean by this is that smoking is one of those relievers, and eating. 

When I come to an NHS Trust I'm told they show hospitality but when I'm locked up within these places I feel my human rights are taken away and I don't feel people are taking everybody into account.

We live as a community and live within equal rights. So where is it equal to those who smoke? Is it right to hide the fact of who you are? What I am trying to say is that smokers seem to have to hide in shame! This shouldn't be the case. Is everybody supposed to hide what they are proud of?

I'd like to state that everybody is equal and nobodys higher than each other! I'd like to say we are all creatures of God, it says in the Bible commandments I shalt not kill or take others as our idols. So where have we got the right to mock each other!

What I am trying to say is we all need something, like I need a cigarette to keep calm but it seems to me this is down to somebody else what do I do!

I am sorry you feel your opinion about smoking does not count. The Smoke-Free Policy was implemented for patients in all buildings and grounds within the Trust from 31st March 2007.  This followed a Government directive to ban smoking in hospitals in order to improve the physical health of patients, staff and visitors.   Your unit will have a local procedure which details the arrangements about smoking as it directly affects you.  I understand that there is also a patient guideline which is available on the ward for you to look at as well.  Individual patients may be granted an exemption from the smoking ban, although the circumstances for exemption are extremely restrictive.  Please speak to your clinical team about this.  

All patients are advised about the risks of smoking as well as the benefits of cutting down or quitting.  As I am not aware of your personal circumstances relating to smoking it would be worth talking about this with staff to see if there is anything that can be done about providing you with alternative stress relievers or smoking cessation support. 

We appreciate your feedback and understand how important this issue is to you. I will pass this posting on to staff.

I hope that you will feel able to discuss this with them.

In my opinion this is only when it suits them. I feel that they have an agenda to tick boxes and as long as you conform to what and how they want something then it's ok!

I didn’t realise I had any illness but once I had accepted the illness and come to terms with reality and my offences, I wanted to get appropriate care and support to prevent relapse and become stable.

Be open and honest and you will do yourself a favour.

Last year I was seen by psychotherapists at Nottinghamshire Healthcare. I didnt want to see therapists in this trust as it is the trust I work for.

My details are now on the trust computer information system for all my colleagues to access. I am open about my mental health problems, but feel it should be my decision who at work I tell, not for colleagues to come across, they certainly shouldnt be able to access my address and other details, but they can.

The therapists were only really animated when they were asking me about how my work affected my mental health, which isnt my main concern.

The therapists I saw were really uncomfortable when I wanted to talk about my homosexuality. My sexuality has impacted on my mental health, and I wanted to talk about it. The therapists reaction was one of disgust and this made me feel worse about myself.

I thought the therapist was very manipulative. When I said I was discharging myself they made further appointments for me which I attended against my better judgement although they did not have anything constructive to say.

After seeing the psychotherapists I became more depressed and anxious, it has taken me about a year to get over the experience.

A lot of money is spent on psychotherapists, and the waiting lists are huge, I wonder who benefits.

We can never refer to details of individual cases and we hope that you will voice your concerns informally or via a formal complaint by contacting the Service Liaison department on 0115 993 4542.

Your question about who benefits from psychotherapies, and there are many different forms of psychotherapy, is an excellent but a complex one. I have passed this question on to Professor Chris Evans who is Clinical Director for Psychological Therapies in Local Services in the Trust who will post a reply next week that will give some information and pointers to more work on the subject.

Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

I notice that there is no comment on how my details are held on the computer system against my wishes which causes me ongoing distress.38882385402010-08-03T18:14:02.15poInvolvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Dr Chris Evan's has followed up your question. As you have raised a query in your latest posting around personal information, this is something that will be need to be followed up. Thank you for your response. 

“Who benefits from psychotherapy?” is a really vital question but incredibly hard to answer in a satisfying and honest way.  One simple answer some of us can give is “I did” and I can say that having had two periods of analytic therapy, one in a group and one individual.  However, it’s easy to say that after the event but even then it’s hard to explain exactly what benefits you got.  For me I’m sure I’m happier, easier to live with and more productive but how that happened is hard to explain and it’s impossible to deny the sceptic’s view that I’d have changed that much anyway.

One problem is that there are many different forms of psychotherapy: you can have therapy without another person: bibliotherapy in which you use a book, computer delivered therapy, self-therapy; you can have “individual therapy”, i.e. with one other person, you can have group, couple and family therapy, even multiple couple and multiple family group therapies.  The therapy can be based on a wide range of theories.  These include analytic/dynamic, humanistic, family/systemic, cognitive and behavioural theories and there are many varieties within each of those and also ways of combining some of them.  Some researchers and therapists argue that all the theories we currently have are hopelessly incomplete and less important than the relationship that develops, often idiosyncratically, between the client and therapist. 

There is an enormous amount of research evidence and research into the question started in the 1930s.  Sadly there are no utterly clear answers yet though it’s clear that many therapies help many people and there’s some evidence that some therapies are best for particular problems or diagnoses though diagnosis doesn’t generally seem to be very important.  There’s also some evidence that some people do better with some therapies than with others and some reason to believe that some therapies have complex change patterns with things often getting worse before getting better and getting a bit worse again at termination but then showing a continuing improvement that goes on long after the therapy ends (“sleeper effects”).  In all, predicting who will do best with what remains very difficult and perhaps always will.

This probably seems a very frustrating answer but it’s an honest one and I believe it to be an accurate reflection of the enormously complex research literature as we have it now.  I’m happy to try to give more detail or to try to answer questions about particular forms of therapy (individual, group, family etc.) or theories.  I’m on leave for the next two weeks so response will be at least that slow.

"702","chewsdaychairman","I was diagnosed with severe depression & anxiety over a decade ago.  I’ve been on various medications and therapies. The treatment and ongoing support I’ve received from all sectors of Nottinghamshire NHS Trust and linked services has, and continues to be excellent. For the past several years I’ve attended some colleges across Nottingham and attended SPAN gaining level two qualifications in Business Administration and IT applications. The Staff and Service Users at SPAN are a true inspiration. They continue to be a life line and support in so many ways as part of my recovery.
During 2009, I was in a very dark place in my life and felt I had to get it back on track by drawing on all my past support networks and therapies. I was listening to Clair Chilvers on local radio talking about Time to Change and Adult Mental Health Services in Notts. I made some enquiries and was pointed in the direction of the The Involvement Centre at Duncan Macmillan House. They are a great team, welcoming and very supportive. My confidence and self esteem has grown and over the past few months. As a volunteer with them I now attend various meetings and conferences about Adult Mental Health. It’s great to be valued as a service user, being part of Nott’s AMH fighting, in a positive way, the stigma around mental health enriching not only my own life, but those who I come in contact with, fellow service users, carers, and a variety of organisations linked in with the Trust.

"705","jess7","Care Plan Assessment

My Community Psychiatric Nurse (CPN) recently gave me my care plan and asked me to sign it. When I looked at it there were only three things on it. These were about my medication and about two appointments I had with my CPN and my Psychiatrist. 

I could not believe that an enhanced level care plan that states there could be 12 headings could be written by my CPN with such a lack of care.

Care plans are designed to look at a person holistically. The categories relate to the persons physical as well as mental health, finances, accommodation, daily living skills, social network, leisure opportunities, employment/ training and culture and childcare.

So I asked my CPN to book me in to spend time on going through my care plan.
What I still find interesting is that physical health seems to be ignored and as I am obese no-one seems concerned about this.

So I had my G.P refer me to Positive Moves or exercise on prescription, which gives me 3 month trial with a local leisure centre. Incidentally I have never been referred to a nutritionist for weight gain due to taking medication.

My CPN has offered me mental health groups as regards to making friends. With the day services closing CPN’S and Social workers should be able to point their service users in the right direction for courses and work.

I am a regular volunteer at the Involvement centre which is part of my recovery and yet it was not mentioned on my care plan. People with mental health problems need to work if they can. For me working raises self esteem and gives me a sense of purpose, which improves my mental health.

So what is happening in 2010 for my CPN to give me such a care plan assessment? Psychiatrists should make sure that service users and Care Plan reviews are dealt with in a positive way to make the most of care plans.

The CPA should be an inclusive review of a number of specific topics, including;
Mental health 
Physical health, 
Accommodation, finances, benefits 
Children, Family and relationships 
Other aspects of social care, activities, inclusion, etc 
Treatments, including drugs, talking therapies, and broader involvement activities 
 
There should also be opportunities for patients to raise specific concerns, as well as highlight their personal objectives for the review.

In some cases, people will be relatively stable and the review does not come up with many action points. In others there may be a variety of things to arrange/recommend.

I have been able to learn new skills and passed some IT exams which I would have found difficult in a mainstream college. I also found the work support course very informative although, because of my mental illness, I have been unable to get a paid job. I still do some voluntary work to occupy myself, get current experience and put on my cv.
Being at SPAN provides a safe environment and has helped me cope with my illness. The staff are understanding and helpful especially when I find it difficult to concentrate and remember things. The small sized group and more individual tuition make all the difference as well as being able to work at my own pace. I also feel less isolated.

"712","geordiedayrider","I have had several prolonged periods of serious depresion in my life and sometimes it seems there are no freindly ears to turn to for help, but one way or another I am still alive and trying for a better tommorrow.
I watched the bbc ""SECTIONED"" on tv twice in the last week and was very much indeared to the young man Richard and his story.
He is the bravest of men I feel, as he happliy opens up to strangers and a camera crew for help and advice. He is so gentle and insigthful I thought, that I have to wish him well.
I feel his use of drink and drugs will not aid his efforts to improve his mentality but they will surely only cloud his mind with strange and negative thoughts, making proffesional medical treatment even more difficult.
It seemed quite obvious to me that he needs help and counselling to address the difficult childhood experiences he had to endure (child sexual abuse and an horrifically violent episode of battery via hot chip fat at the hands of Richards mums then boyfriend).
No real mention of counselling for these events were aired in the programme which i felt was niave to say the least.
I want to wish Richard all the very best, he made me smile and warmed my heart with his cheeky grin and his open manner. I dont smile much these days.
An unhappy childhood never really leaves us does it? but how many people can truely comes to terms with their sad past?
I think a few cuddles along the way or some animal therapy, to give and receive love, should be considered as a valid alternative to hard, addictive anti pshycotic drugs. I know I would prefer this.

However, with their consent, we agreed that their stories were a powerful way to combat stigma and educate the public about the reality of living with a mental illness and the impact this has, not only on the individuals, but also on their families and carers. I am sure your personal experience would support that.

I’ve opted for an open degree which gives me more choice regarding topic options. I am in my fourth year (equivalent of year 2 for conventional universities) and have been in psychiatric hospital for that period of time.
Here at Arnold Lodge, the hospital policy prevents me from owning and utilising my laptop to help me with my studies. The Open University purchased the laptop for me after identifying how useful it would be for me with my mental disability/illness.
As the ward has a PC and there are computers in the education department, they justify its confiscation by saying that equipment is available in the hospital (that they provide) and that will meet my needs. There are many restrictions on usage and what programmes/software I can install on the hospital IT equipment as I am not the administrator of the computers. These restrictions are a serious limitations on my abilities that I miss as I was allowed my laptop in my previous hospitals.
I have raised the issue at the patients forum numerous times with it being referred to the policies committee who have not got back to me. I have formally complained to the hospital manager who reassures me that I will get an answer/reply to my request from policies committee.
They said that any Open University software could be installed on ward computer but three months on and I am still waiting for the software to be installed.

The service users have been advised today that a team of 20 people are coming to SPAN from Stonebridge Centre.  They are having to be housed in the dining room which means that we can no longer use this room for our coffee breaks and lunches.  It seems as if the NHS Trust delights in ignoring the people who benefit from this centre to crowd more and more ""teams"" in.  I personally wonder what is going to happen to me and the other service users here if the NHS Trust decides they need the I.T. Room(where I go for computer courses) to house another bunch of O.T's, Clinical Staff etc.  Will we arrive one day to find that the door to the I.T. room is out of bounds because someone has decided without any discussion with the service users that it would make a nice room for another ""team"".

I think that the NHS Trust should just sit down and remember that if their were no service users with a mental health illness then 2/3 of the O.T's and clinical staff would be made redundant.  Being as there are service users with needs can they please be considered and taken into consideration when things like this take place.

They (who ever they are) are giving us use of another room, small dark and depressing (in my opinion). In the dining room we meet and chat have a game of pool sit and read, it's a very sociable space and now we are losing it.  Yet another facility withdrawn and no one asked our opinion.  It seems to me we are not important enough, we only use the facilities (and we are losing them fast).

On Tuesday March 9th Service and Project Managers attended SPAN to listen to peoples comments about the CAT team moving into the SPAN building.

At the meeting we were assured that the move is only temporary until the beginning of October 2010 when the CAT team will take up their new residence at Highbury Hospital.   

We acknowledged the fact that service users and staff have been upset due to the lack of notice about the CAT team moving in and apologised for the unfortunate lack of communication on this occasion. We have agreed to meet regularly with service users (students) and staff so that channels of communication can remain open. The next meeting to be arranged in 3 Months.

It was clear from the meeting that this is an isolated issue and that the dining room will hopefully be returned to its former use in October providing everything goes to plan with the new build at Highbury.

Provision for dining and breaks has been made available in Admin/IT and the Learning Zone for students using these areas.  The 6th Workshop will also temporarily accommodate breaks and lunch time. 

We did also mention we could spend some money on making the room more friendly and welcoming.

I hope this helps to reassure you that the changes to the environment at SPAN are seen as temporary and that services that you attend are to continue for the foreseeable future.

"722","concerned 1","I was admitted to a ward at the QMC, The toilets were smelly and dirty but the staff were reasonable. I only stayed hours on this ward as I was transferred to another just as I was going to bed. This is my view of what then happened: in the morning I got up and went to the communal room, there were no seat cushions on the furniture I thought the staff were using them to sleep on in the night, I thought they were supposed to be awake night staff. I Proceeded to make myself a drink, and then suddenly hell broke loose, I was surrounded by staff (I just wanted my cup of tea) I was put in a restraining hold by two staff and taken to my bedspace where I was put face down on the bed, the pillow wasnt removed so at times I felt I was suffocating, two staff jumped on my legs, whilst this was happening I was informing them that I had a disability, fibromyalgia, this did not help the staff to decide to stop jumping on my legs or loosen the grip on my wrists and upperarm, I was not struggling as the pain was very bad. I was then injected. within half an hour I was transferred out of the QMC, to the PK unit in Mansfield. I found the whole experience at this unit totally different, and was sent home one week later because there was not a bed available for me back at the QMC. The PK unit informed me that they thought I was going to be very aggressive etc. as this is what the QMC informed them about myself when my bed was secured. I believe that the staff are very despondent about their jobs, they have very few listening skills, and overall very aggressive to patients, the ward itself is unclean and unstimulating, from what I saw the patients spend most of the day in bed drugged up with no one careing about their welfare

"724","cliff fan","Eleven years ago I had a very bad breakdown.  I felt worthless, that I couldn't do anything of importance, that I was a failure and that everyone would be better off if I was no longer alive.

I heard about SPAN Foster Drive and my care worker at Stonebridge sent in a referral for me.   I opted for the computer group even though I did not  know how to turn one on.

I attended the group and the Training Area Manager (Tim) helped me to eventually pass computer exams and feel as if I was capable of actually doing something worthwhile.  I felt as though I was important to my family and that I could eventually get my life back on track.

I have now been volunteering as an Administrator for Tim in the I.T. Group for 4-5 years and I would like to thank him and SPAN for giving me back my life.  I still cannot cope very well with lots of people or buses but I know (hope) that this will get better.

"726","Tim Wood","Working in Mental Health Services is such a rewarding job. The human beings that I work with (who are referred to as patients, clients or service users) are people often short of some human warmth and understanding.

I have worked in Nottingham's Mental Health Services for over 20 years and have seen many changes to the service.  We are now (on the whole) more caring and understanding of the people we work with.  It is unfortunate that sometimes the Mental Health Service attracts less caring staff who appear to like what they see as power over the patients that they work with.  This is changing and is helped by having staff reveal their susceptibility to mental health issues in their life (Coming Out) and so I feel I need to support this emancipation by telling my story.

I suppose all of my life I have suffered from a depressive disorder, maybe I didn't realise until my early thirties that this is what it was.  I know there were times that I really struggled to understand why I felt so miserable, even as a child I remember dark moments and frightening thoughts of wanting to be dead or take my life, because no one understood me.

As the years have gone by I have become better at managing the bouts of depression that from time to time pop up to remind me that they are still there.  Treating the depression as a small part of me has been far more beneficial than treating me as a depressive (labelling me).  For the majority of the time I am now able to live my life understanding that there may still be down times, but ensuring I make the most of the up times.  It is only in the past year that the thoughts of wanting to be dead or kill myself have lessened, but these are symptoms of an illness that is part of me.  Knowing how to cope with this is the key.  Adopting a coping strategy that gets me through the times when I am stuggling with depression has meant a swifter recovery during times that I am unwell.

I last had a bout of depression in October/November of this year (2009) and boy it was a lot easier to cope with. Two months off of work not because I couldn't cope with the depression but because I was unable to give my all to the service users (human beings) that I work with.

I have received excellent support from my manager and more importantly from our deputy manager Steve.  Steve is keen on job retention, he supports many service users to remain in work by negotiating reasonable adjustments to help retain what for most of us is a vital part of our lives (our jobs). Steve gave me this support and it was of great value to know that someone was their to offer me support if I needed it.

Due to the flexible working approach that the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust has, I have been able to return to work with ample support and flexibility to my working hours.

Change is an important aspect of any service, however I am concerned that some changes will leave the more vulnerable more vulnerable, similar to when 'Care in the Community' was first introduced.  

With the support of the Exemplar Employment lead (Mike) I am developing work experience placements which enable the people I work with to access employment opportunities that go to promote future paid employment for those service users (human beings) that feel they could and would like to engae in work. 

I hope this story helps assure people that there is life beyond mental ill health.  Although the deppresive times are difficult I have been able to learn from them and it as made me a far more compassionate and understanding human being, qualities that are so valuable in our workforce.

"728","FrankM","I suffered from mental ill-health in December 2007 and am recovering well thanks to the service provided by the NHS and my aftercare team in Nottingham. 

I was admitted and sectioned at Queens Medical Hospital where I recieved treatment until I was feeling better and assessed by the doctor to come out. I was in Hospital for a period of six months. I was sectioned for 3 months and was suppossed to leave hospital after the 3 months but stayed  for a further 3 months due to my accomodation being sorted. I can say this was the only problem I faced, the long wait to get accomodation. During this period I also noticed and talked to some fellow patients who were also well but still staying in hospital because their accomodation was not ready. 

I can also say since I am African I expected to get an offer for some sort of African dishes on the menu, I found it hard to eat some of the dishes offered. They were Carribean and Indian dishes offered on the menu options. As I got better there were cookery classes offered where I was able to cook some food for myself which was very good for me.

When I got out of Hospital the services offered to me by my peer team was excellent and I am now doing voluntary work and working torwards enhancing my IT skills which I am currently doing at SPAN.

However he is in porchester ward to get clean at the moment before he move to rehab which we are pleased will happen after more than ten yrs to put up with his addiction and his emotion. It was so chaotic to affect the family life but we never fault him as in the end of day its illness.
I am just angry that we dont have any support from drug unit to give us advice or whatever as there was problem with communication and they wont book an interpreter however I rather they use the money to spend on the people who need help to beat their drugs. They should have a service for the deaf, for the families of addiction or for the deaf people who have addiction problem?? We never attend any groups to help us to calm our emotion or talk to someone who has similar experience as us, we just get on with life as normal as we can.
But I would like to say thanks to the service for making my brothers dream come true to go rehab to sort himself out which he told me last week that he feel he got hope whereas before he feel like there is no way to get out from dark life he leaded which he hated but cant help himself. It’s first time I see my brothers face so lift up and smile and he is finally looking forward to start life over again but one that will be far better so many thanks.
Hope one day there will be a service for the deaf families or for the deaf who got addiction as communication is the key to help them to understand better or get more help from the service etc...best luck xxx

It’s so great to hear that your brother had such a positive experience on our unit and is now experiencing more hope in his life. However, I am disappointed that you feel the support was lacking for you and your family in meeting your specific needs. Our service has access to interpreters and BSL signers and we work closely with carer support organisations to ensure all our clients and families get information and support they need.  I completely agree with you that communication with families is very important and clearly in this instance we failed to provide sufficient support for you. 

In order to address this issue I have asked the Ward Manager and Modern Matron to contact our specialist mental health service for the deaf to ask for their advice and support in ensuring we are more capable of meeting the needs of people with hearing difficulties in future. I will also pass on your comments to our carers support partner agencies in the hope that they will explore opportunities to improve their provision for carers who are deaf.

Please accept my apologies and pass on our congratulations and best wishes for the future to your brother.

Whilst on our inpatient units we always strive to keep consistent appointment times, we are aware that these times can on occasion run over, we apologise that you have witnessed delay and inconsistency with appointments and we hope you will pass this on to the service users affected.

On each of our inpatient units the consultant psychiatrists have allocated times when they attend the unit, these times are the same every week. Service users are able to book a time slot to see the consultant with or without relatives or key workers. If service users do not take this option nursing staff will usually allocate them a time. These appointment times should be clearly displayed on all wards to ensure service users and anyone accompanying them are aware of when their appointments are. 

Some wards operate different procedures and depending on length of stay would not always see a consultant psychiatrist but may see a registrar or staff grade doctor (both of whom are fully qualified), regardless the service user should be made aware of when this is likely to happen. 

I will ensure this information is feedback to the inpatient teams and would ask that you please alert us if you have any further issues.

I suggest that it should be available on all in patient mental health wards, either as a poster or given to people at an appropriate time.

This should also be raised at the point of admission for all patients (or as soon as is practicable given their presentation)but most importantly for those detained under the mental health act. Patients have their rights read and are given information about what the detention means and how they can appeal against that detention if they so wish. 

We will help them access legal representation and advocacy if they require.

He has very complex needs because he also suffers with an affective disorder - he is a pussy cat one minute and very difficult to handle the next! I'd like to thank all the members of the multi-disciplinary team that have been and are still involved in his care, the staff of that unit and the staff at Horizon day centre. They have all worked so well together towards helping him move into the community which should happen at the end of January. The process of his move to the community has been handled with a person-centered approach and I have been very involved in the interveiwing of his future staff for when he moves. The service has always been so willing to listen to me and I have been able to be involved with and influence the process. The support I've received this year under particularly difficult circumstances has been fantastic. Everyone involved has been like our extended family and I am sincerely grateful to them all.

"740","kez","I have been a patient since I was 14 years old, and so has my brother.
I was diagnosed with having bipolar and my brother schizophrenia.
we both are now in hospital but in two different areas. I’m in Nottingham he's in Wolverhampton. I am now 20yrs old and he is 22yrs old. we both have been sectioned, but over 1year, it's not right we are both intelligent,
we have potential in life to do what is normal like everyone else.
my mum had a breakdown in 1982 she survived and is coping at the moment, but to see my mum struggling for help where she needs it most no-one listens to her views. my brother and I went to special school as youngsters, we are both vulnerable as we care for others around us. the fact is we don't like the way staff treat us. they do not understand the reality of ones pain  and this becomes a battleground in the long run.
I've been in so many hospitals so has my brother, it's a shame!
I'm in the QMC in Nottingham where i stay at a rehab, but they say they have not got facilities to help me. Why am i classed as hard to treat yet all mental illness is the same, it's crazy! just a pay packet for them and not working to there best interest as my life has no value to those who work in this profession. I look around me and see people get abused by staff and when you say anything about the issue, they say it's down to your illness, or imagination. <strong>This has got to stop</strong>.
we are much human as any one else, feelings, needs. I don't believe in neglect of <em>duty</em>...This system needs to be put right as some wards are crowded and other patients influence others like me. it's a learned process being with them 24 hr 7 days a week. I’m too intelligent to wanting to be stuck in another world where people are not in reality like chickens in a pen. barbaric! we are the forgotten people but used for £24,000 a year pay-packet.","RHANottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustRHANG3 6AANottinghammental health trust","Today","the patient","14023","Paul  Sanguinazzi, Head of Involvement, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustPaul  Sanguinazzi, Head of Involvement, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustDear Kez, 

Thank you for providing this feedback on our services.  Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust has only signed up to Patient Opinion recently so we have only now seen your post.

We are really sorry to hear about the difficulties that you and your brother have had and that you felt your experience on our wards was poor with staff treating you badly. 

I was saddened to hear that you felt that we had not offered you the help you need to reach your potential. It is always our intention to support people to live their lives to the fullest and as independently as possible but it is clear from what you say that we haven’t yet achieved this in your case and we want to help. 

You mention in your posting that you care for others around you. We know that this can be hard and can impact on your health.  Carers Federation can provide information and support for carers on an individual basis and also run a Carer Support Group.  You can contact Carers Federation on 0115 9128028, 0115 9128029 or 0115 9128030.

I am upset to hear that you feel that the staff you have dealt with see ‘no value’ in your life. We always aim to do the best we can for everyone we see and I hope that since you posted on here your experiences in our Trust have been more positive. We would be really interested to hear about this and would encourage you to post again or speak to us on the number below. 

It sounds as though you have some clear ideas about how we could do better and what would really make a difference to you – please tell us. It is so valuable to us and it is important to us that people tell us about their experiences so that we can improve our services. 

I have thought carefully about your experience and how it could have been better and I will be passing on your comments to staff on our wards at QMC and their managers to ensure that we learn from your experiences. 

If there are still any outstanding issues, please contact PALS on 0800 015 3367 or by <a href=""mailto:pals@nottshc.nhs.uk"">email</a> and we will be happy to discuss them with you.

"741","mary christine","My son is almost 17 now and has been extremely dizzy for three and a half years. He has been out of school for this time, albeit receiving some home education, but not enough to even take GCSEs, let alone achieve any. Although the home education was outstanding, his non achieving was due to the state he is in.
I feel he is now on some scrap heap for the rest of his days. His problem also is, he seems to have severe phobias about anything medical. Therefore, will not go to the doctors/dentist etc for fear of fainting. His last visit to the dentist was when he was about 11/12 and he now desperately needs dental treatment.
He feels very ill if someone mentions needles, and not just for half an hour or so – he can be ill for days after. He has fainted at home at the sight of a sowing needle, passed out at school during a biology lesson, was very ill when he knew he had to have the TB jab and was off school, therefore did not receive it. These are just a few examples of what his life is like.
He also has asthma, which results in breathing difficulties from time to time - but cannot bring himself to go out, let alone go to the doctors for a check up. I am so worried about what will happen when he runs out of inhalers, which could be soon, what do i do? It seems to be a desperate situation for me.
He is supposed to be under the local mental health team, but the wheels there turn very, very slowly. I feel he is not bothered with, can someone please, please help. There must be someone out there who can help and who knows what to do.","5EMNottingham City PCT5EMNG1 6GNNottinghamprimary care trustRHANottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustRHANG3 6AANottinghammental health trust","Today","a relative","13604","Charlotte Lawson-Braley, Support and Development Manager, PrincipiaCharlotte Lawson-Braley, Support and Development Manager, PrincipiaDear Mary,

I was concerned to hear about your son, I know you son feels unable to visit his GP but perhaps you could visit his GP on his behalf. As a healthcare professional, your GP will be able to offer advice and support and will be able to put you into contact with other professionals.

If you do have concerns with the level of care you son is receiving from the local mental health team than Amanda or Sally at the Patient Advice and Liaison service (PALs) will be able to help you their contact details are below.

"742","helen","What I liked
the way the staff make the effort to make you welcome, involve you and take away some of the pain associated with the conditions treated at the hospital.  The way they try their best to do constructive things and the way they are genuinely open to suggestion.  The events put on where carers can come make you as a carer feel looked after and involved, it&apos;s taken away a lot of the fear and mytsery surrounding mental health issues.  I feel safer knowing patients are cared for to the best the of people&apos;s abilities.   I think the staff are in general absolutely excellent.
What could be improved
if it could just go on and on as time has a different dimension here, it&apos;s not about progressing in steps upwards towards a goal rather maybe about managing a lifetime of this and as much help as possible in understanding this and how to handle it is welcome and apreciated thank you","RHANottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustRHANG3 6AANottinghammental health trust","Unknown","","34777","Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Jane Danforth, Involvement Team , Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Thank you very much for your posting.
